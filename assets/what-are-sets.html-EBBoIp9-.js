This eliminates them from many places where you would use an array, but they do have one special super-power: it‚Äôs extremely fast to check whether a set contains a specific value. In fact, sets perform this operation at the same speed whether they contain 10 items or 10,000 items.\n\nSets can be created directly from arrays, then used like them in many ways. For example:\n\n```swift\nvar numbers = Set([1, 2, 3])\n```\n\nYou can then go ahead and check whether that contains a specific value, like this:\n\n```swift\nprint(numbers.contains(5))\n```\n\nBecause sets don‚Äôt have any concept of ordering, they don‚Äôt have an `append()` method. Instead, they use `insert()`, like this:\n\n```swift\nnumbers.insert(5)\n```\n\n"),f])}const v=i(m,[["render",y],["__file","what-are-sets.html.vue"]]),x=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-are-sets.html","title":"What are sets?","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"What are sets?","description":"Article(s) > What are sets?","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > What are sets?"},{"property":"og:description","content":"What are sets?"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-are-sets.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-are-sets.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"What are sets?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > What are sets?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"What are sets?\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.17,"words":351},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-are-sets.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{v as comp,x as data};
