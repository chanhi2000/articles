Every \`UIView\` has an anchor point, which is the point around which animations take place. Usually this is the center of the view ‚Äì X:0.5 Y:0.5 ‚Äì which means if you rotate a view it will spin around its center.

If you wanted the view to rotate around its top corner, as if someone had driven a nail into that point and you were spinning the view around that corner rather than the center, you can change the anchor point using the \`layer.anchorPoint\` property.

However, there‚Äôs a problem: changing the anchor point also changes the point where the view‚Äôs position is calculated, which means changing the anchor point also moves the view‚Äôs position.

So, if you want to change a view‚Äôs anchor point *without* moving it, here‚Äôs a little extension to do just that:

\`\`\`swift
extension UIView {
    func setAnchorPoint(_ point: CGPoint) {
        var newPoint = CGPoint(x: bounds.size.width * point.x, y: bounds.size.height * point.y)
        var oldPoint = CGPoint(x: bounds.size.width * layer.anchorPoint.x, y: bounds.size.height * layer.anchorPoint.y);

        newPoint = newPoint.applying(transform)
        oldPoint = oldPoint.applying(transform)

        var position = layer.position

        position.x -= oldPoint.x
        position.x += newPoint.x

        position.y -= oldPoint.y
        position.y += newPoint.y

        layer.position = position
        layer.anchorPoint = point
    }
}
\`\`\`

If you want to see that in action, here‚Äôs some code to create a blue \`UIView\` then animate it rotating around its top-left corner:

\`\`\`swift
let box = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 256, height: 256))
box.backgroundColor = .blue
view.addSubview(box)

box.setAnchorPoint(CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0))

UIView.animate(withDuration: 3) {
    box.transform = CGAffineTransform(rotationAngle: .pi)
}
\`\`\`
