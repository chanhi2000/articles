When the client sends a CONNECT request, the server creates a tunnel that allows encrypted data to flow between the client and the destination server. This method is crucial for securing connections, especially when dealing with HTTPS.</p><p>CONNECT does not handle any actual data on its own. Instead, it sets up a path for secure communication, allowing encrypted information to pass through proxies without being modified or inspected.</p><hr><h2 id="how-connect-works" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-connect-works"><span>How CONNECT Works</span></a></h2><h3 id="_1-sending-a-connect-request" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-sending-a-connect-request"><span>1. Sending a CONNECT Request</span></a></h3><p>A client, such as a web browser, sends a CONNECT request to the proxy server. This request includes the target server&#39;s hostname and port, typically the standard HTTPS port (443). For example, when accessing <code>https://example.com</code>, the browser sends a CONNECT request to the proxy server asking it to connect to that domain on port 443.</p><h3 id="_2-establishing-the-tunnel" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-establishing-the-tunnel"><span>2. Establishing the Tunnel</span></a></h3><p>The proxy server, upon receiving the CONNECT request, establishes a tunnel to the destination server. This tunnel allows encrypted communication to pass through without interference. The proxy simply forwards traffic between the client and the destination, acting as a relay.</p><h3 id="_3-encrypted-communication" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-encrypted-communication"><span>3. Encrypted Communication</span></a></h3><p>Once the tunnel is set up, the client and the destination server can communicate directly using a secure encryption protocol, such as TLS (used by HTTPS). The proxy cannot decrypt or modify the data passing through because it’s encrypted between the client and the server.</p><h3 id="_4-secure-data-transfer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-secure-data-transfer"><span>4. Secure Data Transfer</span></a></h3><p>With the CONNECT method, sensitive data—such as login credentials, personal information, or financial transactions—can be transmitted securely between the client and the server, even when passing through proxies. The encrypted tunnel ensures that the data remains confidential and intact.</p><hr><h2 id="example-of-a-connect-request-and-response" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#example-of-a-connect-request-and-response"><span>Example of a CONNECT Request and Response</span></a></h2>',14),x=e("div",{class:"language-text line-numbers-mode","data-highlighter":"prismjs","data-ext":"text","data-title":"text"},[e("pre",null,[e("code",null,[e("span",{class:"line"},"CONNECT example.com:443 HTTP/1.1"),t(`

The proxy acts as a middleman but does not interfere with or access the encrypted data being transmitted through the tunnel.</p><h3 id="steps-of-the-tunneling-process" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#steps-of-the-tunneling-process"><span>Steps of the Tunneling Process:</span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Sending the CONNECT Request</strong>: The client sends a CONNECT request to the proxy, specifying the destination server and port (for example, port 443 for HTTPS).</li><li><strong>Proxy Sets Up the Tunnel</strong>: The proxy server establishes a secure tunnel between the client and the destination server, forwarding traffic between the two endpoints.</li><li><strong>Encrypted Communication Begins</strong>: The client and the destination server communicate directly through the encrypted tunnel using HTTPS or another encryption protocol. The proxy forwards the encrypted traffic but cannot access or modify it.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="typical-use-cases-of-the-connect-method" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#typical-use-cases-of-the-connect-method"><span>Typical Use Cases of the CONNECT Method</span></a></h2><ol><li><strong>HTTPS Through Proxies</strong>: One of the most common uses of the CONNECT method is enabling <strong>HTTPS traffic through proxies</strong>. In many corporate or network environments, internet traffic must pass through a proxy server. For secure websites using HTTPS, the CONNECT method allows the proxy server to establish a tunnel, forwarding encrypted traffic between the client and the destination server without inspecting the data. <ul><li><strong>Example</strong>: When you visit a secure banking website from a corporate network, your browser may need to pass through a corporate proxy. The CONNECT method is used to establish an encrypted tunnel between your browser and the bank&#39;s website, allowing sensitive data (such as login credentials) to pass through the proxy securely.</li></ul></li><li><strong>VPNs and Secure Channels</strong>: <strong>VPN (Virtual Private Network)</strong> services also rely on similar tunneling techniques to encrypt and route internet traffic securely. Some VPN services use CONNECT to create secure tunnels, ensuring that all data transmitted between the user and the internet is encrypted and safe from eavesdropping.</li><li><strong>Accessing Blocked Content</strong>: In environments where certain websites are blocked (for example, schools or offices), CONNECT can sometimes be used to bypass restrictions by establishing a tunnel through a proxy. Although this practice may violate network policies, it illustrates how CONNECT can be used to establish secure, unmonitored access to otherwise blocked resources.</li><li><strong>Custom Proxies</strong>: Developers may set up <strong>custom proxies</strong> to route application traffic for performance or security reasons. In these cases, CONNECT allows HTTPS or other secure traffic to pass through the proxy while maintaining privacy and security, as the proxy server cannot access the encrypted data inside the tunnel.</li></ol><hr><h2 id="security-considerations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#security-considerations"><span>Security Considerations</span></a></h2><p>While CONNECT is essential for secure communications, it also presents some security challenges:</p><ul><li><strong>Bypassing Content Filters</strong>: Since CONNECT creates an encrypted tunnel that proxies cannot inspect, it can be used to bypass content filtering systems. This allows users to access restricted websites or services, which may violate organizational policies.</li><li><strong>Tunneling Malicious Traffic</strong>: CONNECT can be exploited by malicious actors to tunnel harmful or unauthorized traffic through a proxy. Because the traffic is encrypted, firewalls and security systems may not detect malicious activity.</li><li><strong>Mitigation</strong>: Many organizations address these risks by closely monitoring and restricting the use of the CONNECT method. Some proxies perform <strong>SSL interception</strong> to decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic, though this introduces privacy concerns and may compromise user security.</li></ul>',12);function S(l,P){const h=a("VPCard"),o=a("router-link"),d=a("SiteInfo"),p=a("Tabs");return T(),m("div",null,[e("h1",C,[e("a",w,[e("span",null,g(l.$frontmatter.title)+" 관련",1)])]),s(h,f(y({title:"Learn HTTP Methods like GET, POST, and DELETE – a Handbook with Code Examples",desc:"When you interact with websites or apps, a lot happens behind the scenes.
