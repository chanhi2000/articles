However, if you&#39;re just prototyping your user interface you can use a constant binding instead, like this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token class-name">Toggle</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>isOn<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">constant</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>
