Some folks use ‚Äúfunction‚Äù and ‚Äúmethod‚Äù interchangeably, but there‚Äôs a small difference: both of them are reusable chunks of code, but methods belong to classes, structs, and enums, whereas functions do not.

So:

\`\`\`swift
func thisIsAFunction() {
}

struct Person {
    func thisIsAMethod() {
    }
}
\`\`\`

Because methods always belong to a data type, they have a concept of \`self\` that functions do not. This is a special value passed in by Swift, and it refers to whatever instance the method was called on.

Swift uses the same keyword, \`func\`, for both functions and methods.
