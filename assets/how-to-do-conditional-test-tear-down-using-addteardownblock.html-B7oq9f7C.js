But sometimes you need to add *conditional* tear down code: if your test creates a resource that must be destroyed, you can add that as an additional tear down step using the `addTeardownBlock()` method.\n\nAs an example, consider this test method:\n\n```swift\nfunc testDatabaseQuery() {\n    let database = connectToDatabase()\n    let results = database.fetchExampleData()\n\n    XCTAssertEqual(results.count, 1, "We should receive exactly one result.")\n}\n```\n\nThat connects to a database, runs an example query, and checks the result. However, behind the scenes our database needs to be reset every time a connection is finished. If *all* our tests relied on the database being created then we could add the cleanup code either to the `tearDown()` instance method or to the `tearDown()` class method, but if it‚Äôs only used *sometimes* then that isn‚Äôt an option.\n\nFortunately, the `addTeardownBlock()` is designed to fix this: you can pass in any code you want to run when your test is being torn down, and it will be run after the current test finishes, but before the `tearDown()` instance method.\n\nIn the case of the `connectToDatabase()` method that needs clean up, we *could* write that clean up code directly into each test, but that just duplicates code and is likely to cause problems. So, instead we‚Äôre going to add the clean up right inside the connection code, like this:\n\n```swift\nfunc connectToDatabase() -> Database {\n    let database = Database()\n    database.connect()\n\n    addTeardownBlock {\n        database.cleanUp()\n    }\n\n    return database\n}\n```\n\nThat `database.cleanUp()` code will be called only when the surrounding test is complete, so it acts a bit like `defer` except the scope is the current test.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to get the order of set up and tear down correct, because various things happen at different times. If you have two tests in your `XCTestCase` here‚Äôs how it would look:\n\n1. The `setUp()` class method is called.\n<li>The `setUp()` instance method is called.\n<li>One test is run.\n<li>Any tear down blocks that were registered are run.\n<li>The `tearDown()` instance method is called.\n<li>The `setUp()` instance method is called again.\n<li>The second test is run.\n<li>Any tear down blocks that were registered are run.\n<li>The `tearDown()` instance method is called again.\n<li>The `tearDown()` class method is called.\n\nYou won‚Äôt need to use tear down blocks often, but they are a useful tool to have.\n\n'),f])}const x=d(w,[["render",b],["__file","how-to-do-conditional-test-tear-down-using-addteardownblock.html.vue"]]),_=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/testing/how-to-do-conditional-test-tear-down-using-addteardownblock.html","title":"How to do conditional test tear down using addTeardownBlock()","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"How to do conditional test tear down using addTeardownBlock()","description":"Article(s) > How to do conditional test tear down using addTeardownBlock()","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > How to do conditional test tear down using addTeardownBlock()"},{"property":"og:description","content":"How to do conditional test tear down using addTeardownBlock()"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/testing/how-to-do-conditional-test-tear-down-using-addteardownblock.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/testing/how-to-do-conditional-test-tear-down-using-addteardownblock.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"How to do conditional test tear down using addTeardownBlock()"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > How to do conditional test tear down using addTeardownBlock()"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2018-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"How to do conditional test tear down using addTeardownBlock()\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2018-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2018-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":2.27,"words":680},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/testing/how-to-do-conditional-test-tear-down-using-addteardownblock.md","localizedDate":"2018ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{x as comp,_ as data};
