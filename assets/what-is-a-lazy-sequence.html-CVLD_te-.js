Lazy sequences are regular sequences where each item is computed on demand rather than up front. For example, consider this array of numbers:

\`\`\`swift
let numbers = Array(1...100000)
\`\`\`

That will hold 100,000 numbers. Now, if we wanted to double all those numbers, we‚Äôd write something like this:

\`\`\`swift
let doubled = numbers.map { $0 * 2 }
\`\`\`

That will cause Swift to double all 100,000 numbers, and sometimes that‚Äôs exactly what you want. However, if you know you intend to use only a handful of them, you can make the calculation lazy instead, like this:

\`\`\`swift
let lazyDoubled = numbers.lazy.map { $0 * 2 }
\`\`\`

Now that \`map()\` call won‚Äôt do any work up front ‚Äì it just stores the original array (numbers 1 to 100,000) alongside the transformation closure (double each number). So, when you request item 5,000 it can calculate just that one for you and return it in a split second ‚Äì a significant time saving.
