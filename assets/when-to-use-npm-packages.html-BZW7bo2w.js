Developers from around the globe actively add to the npm ecosystem by creating and sharing packages. This means you&#39;re not just depending on your skills – you&#39;re benefiting from the collective knowledge and experience of many developers.</p><p>If you run into a problem with a package, you can simply check out forums or GitHub repositories where someone else may have encountered the same issue and can help out.

Let me share a story from my time learning with my mentor, let&#39;s call him Hihi.</p><figure><img src="https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2024/06/wink-meme.jpg" alt="Wink meme" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption><em>Wink meme</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hihi was all about building strong coding skills from the ground up. He often said, &quot;<em>Packages are handy shortcuts, but if you rely on them too much, you might end up stuck.</em>&quot;</p><p>I remember how he&#39;d challenge me to build UI components like dropdown menus, sliders, animations and so on without using any packages. It was tough, but it taught me a lot about how things work behind the scenes.</p><p>Hihi had seen firsthand how relying too much on packages could trip up developers. He&#39;d tell me about people he knew who struggled to implement features when they didn&#39;t have their trusty packages to lean on. It wasn&#39;t just about being a coding genius—it was about understanding the fundamentals and learning to think outside the box.</p><p>And you know what? Hihi was right.

This can lead to a mess of dependencies that become tricky to handle and keep up to date.</p><p>Plus, updating a package can sometimes cause unexpected issues, potentially breaking your application&#39;s functionality.</p><h3 id="security-risks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#security-risks"><span>Security Risks</span></a></h3><p>Not all npm packages are created equal. Some may contain vulnerabilities or even malicious code (often seen in the terminal right after installing a package), putting your projects at risk. Relying too heavily on packages without vetting them properly can leave your projects vulnerable to attacks.</p><h3 id="maintenance-burden" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#maintenance-burden"><span>Maintenance Burden</span></a></h3><p>When you rely on npm packages for essential functionality, you&#39;re at the mercy of the package maintainers.

If you only need one or two features, building those features yourself may be more efficient.</li><li><strong>Package Size</strong>: Larger packages contribute to increased bundle size, which can impact performance. Opt for smaller, more lightweight packages whenever possible.</li><li><strong>Complexity of Functionality</strong>: Evaluate whether the functionality provided by the package is fairly complex to implement from scratch. If so, using the package may save time and effort.</li><li><strong>Project Time Estimate</strong>: Consider the timeline of your project. If you&#39;re working on a tight deadline, using npm packages can speed up development and meet project milestones more quickly.</li><li><strong>Maintenance and Support</strong>: Prioritize packages with ongoing maintenance and strong community support. Opt for those with dedicated maintainers and an active community, as they are more likely to receive prompt updates and assistance when needed.</li><li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Ensure that the package is compatible with your project&#39;s tech stack, including programming languages, frameworks, and dependencies.</li></ul><p>To better guide you, here’s a flowchart of how your decision-making process can go.</p><figure><img src="https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2024/06/Flowchart-of-decision-making.png" alt="How to decide which npm packages to use - and whether to use them." tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption><em>How to decide which npm packages to use - and whether to use them.</em></figcaption></figure><p>As seen in the graph above, each step is built on the next, aiding you in making a sound choice when picking a package.</p><hr><h2 id="efficient-approach-to-using-npm-packages" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#efficient-approach-to-using-npm-packages"><span>Efficient Approach to Using npm Packages</span></a></h2><p>While packages can be incredibly useful for streamlining development and adding advanced features, it&#39;s important to consider when you should use them and when it might not be necessary.</p><h3 id="when-to-use-npm-packages" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#when-to-use-npm-packages"><span>When to Use npm Packages</span></a></h3>',22),z=e("li",null,[e("strong",null,"Routing"),a(": If your web app needs complex navigation, grabbing a battle-tested routing library like React Router can make your life a lot easier.
