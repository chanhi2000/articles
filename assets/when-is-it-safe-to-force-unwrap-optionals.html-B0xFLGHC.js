For example, when you create a new application, your `AppDelegate` class has an optional `UIWindow` property called `window`. Or there‚Äôs the `Bundle` class, which has an optional `URL` property called `resourceURL` property that points to where your bundle‚Äôs resources are.\n\nBoth of those are optional, but if either of them fail something is seriously wrong with your application ‚Äì should you really be trying to carry on running if your app is in such a corrupt state?\n\nThink about when you try to instantiate a view controller with an identifier. Apple‚Äôs API here doesn‚Äôt throw errors, and doesn‚Äôt return an optional view controller ‚Äì it just hard crashes, because there‚Äôs no sensible way for the app to continue if it‚Äôs missing a whole storyboard identifier.\n\nYou can apply that same logic to your code: if you‚Äôre trying to load a `UIImage` from your asset catalog, force unwrapping is a sensible thing to do because if that image is missing it means you‚Äôve either made a serious mistake or your app is in a damaged state and forcing a crash might help limit corruption of user data.\n\n"),y])}const v=s(u,[["render",b],["__file","when-is-it-safe-to-force-unwrap-optionals.html.vue"]]),S=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/when-is-it-safe-to-force-unwrap-optionals.html","title":"When is it safe to force unwrap optionals?","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"When is it safe to force unwrap optionals?","description":"Article(s) > When is it safe to force unwrap optionals?","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-8.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > When is it safe to force unwrap optionals?"},{"property":"og:description","content":"When is it safe to force unwrap optionals?"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/when-is-it-safe-to-force-unwrap-optionals.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/when-is-it-safe-to-force-unwrap-optionals.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"When is it safe to force unwrap optionals?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > When is it safe to force unwrap optionals?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-8.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"When is it safe to force unwrap optionals?\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.76,"words":527},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/when-is-it-safe-to-force-unwrap-optionals.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{v as comp,S as data};
