Swift‚Äôs strings are stored in a specific way that stops you from indexing into then easily. In fact, reading one letter from part-way through the string means starting at the beginning of the string and counting through letters until you find the one you want, so if you try reading *all* the characters in the string this way you could accidentally create extremely slow code.

However, if you only need to read one or two letters, here‚Äôs a simple extension on \`String\` that will help:

\`\`\`swift
extension String {
    subscript(i: Int) -> String {
        return String(self[index(startIndex, offsetBy: i)])
    }
}
\`\`\`

With that place in place, you can write \`myString[15]\` to read the 16th letter.
