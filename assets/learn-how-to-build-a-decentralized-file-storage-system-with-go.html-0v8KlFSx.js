He has over 20 years of experience as a software developer and has created many popular courses.</p><p>The course takes you through the entire process of building a scalable application from scratch. You&#39;ll start by creating a peer-to-peer TCP library in Go and then move on to developing a file storage system that can handle and stream very large files.</p><p>Here are some of the key topics covered:</p><ul><li><strong>System Design</strong>: Understand the principles behind designing a robust and scalable decentralized system.</li><li><strong>Low-Level Programming</strong>: Dive deep into the intricacies of low-level programming with Go.</li><li><strong>Network Protocols</strong>: Learn about various network protocols and how to implement them in a real-world application.</li><li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Communication</strong>: Build a peer-to-peer library to facilitate communication between nodes in your network.</li><li><strong>File Storage and Streaming</strong>: Develop a system capable of handling large files, ensuring efficient storage and streaming capabilities.</li><li><strong>Version Control and Caching</strong>: Implement versioning and caching mechanisms to optimize performance and reliability.</li></ul><p>Anthony starts with the basics, guiding you through creating a main Go file and setting up your project environment. As you progress, you&#39;ll build and test your TCP library, develop interfaces for peer communication, and create a comprehensive storage system with hashing and encryption functionalities.</p><p>The course is designed to be hands-on, with plenty of coding exercises and practical examples. By the end of the course, you&#39;ll have a fully functional decentralized file storage system and a solid understanding of the underlying technologies.</p>",6),z={href:"youtu.be/IoY6bE--A54"};function G(n,k){const i=a("VPCard"),s=a("SiteInfo"),r=a("FontIcon"),l=a("VidStack");return u(),d("div",null,[e("h1",y,[e("a",b,[e("span",null,g(n.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),o(i,h(p({title:"Go > Article(s)",desc:"Article(s)",link:"/programming/go/articles/README.md",logo:"/images/ico-wind.svg",background:"rgba(10,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),w,_,o(s,{name:"Learn How to Build a Decentralized File Storage System with Go",desc:"We just posted a 10-hour course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a decentralized, fully distributed, content-addressable file storage system using Go.
