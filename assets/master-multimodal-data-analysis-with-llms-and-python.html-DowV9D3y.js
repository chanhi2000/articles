This course will teach you how to leverage LLMs to perform sophisticated, multimodal data analysis with just a few lines of Python code.</p><p>This comprehensive tutorial was developed by Dr. Immanuel Trummer, an associate professor at Cornell University. It offers a deep dive into the cutting-edge techniques of analyzing various types of data using state-of-the-art language models.</p><p>Here are some of the key topics covered in the course:</p><ol><li>Text Classification with LLMs: Learn how to leverage the power of language models to classify text data efficiently and accurately.</li><li>Image Analysis: Discover techniques for answering questions about images, opening up new possibilities for visual data interpretation.</li><li>Audio Data Processing: Master the art of transcribing speech to text, enabling you to work with audio data in new and innovative ways.</li><li>Natural Language Querying of Databases: Build a natural language query interface for SQL databases, making data exploration more intuitive and accessible.</li></ol><p>And here are some of the things that make this course stand out:</p><ul><li>Hands-on Learning: The course provides practical, code-based examples that you can follow along with and adapt to your own projects.</li><li>Multimodal Approach: By covering text, image, and audio data, the course prepares you for a wide range of real-world data analysis scenarios.</li><li>Expert Instruction: Benefit from the knowledge and experience of Dr. Trummer, a respected researcher and educator in the field of data management and LLMs.</li><li>Comprehensive Resources: Access to a wealth of supporting materials, including code samples, datasets, and additional learning resources.</li></ul><p>This course is perfect for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and anyone interested in pushing the boundaries of what&#39;s possible with LLMs and data analysis. Whether you&#39;re looking to enhance your current skillset or pivot into the exciting field of AI-powered data analysis, this tutorial provides a solid foundation and practical skills you can apply immediately.</p>",8),v={href:"https://youtu.be/3-4qAkFRpAk",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function A(r,_){const n=a("VPCard"),l=a("SiteInfo"),c=a("FontIcon"),d=a("VidStack");return g(),h("div",null,[e("h1",f,[e("a",b,[e("span",null,m(r.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),t(n,s(i({title:"Python > Article(s)",desc:"Article(s)",link:"/programming/py/articles/README.md",logo:"/images/ico-wind.svg",background:"rgba(10,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),t(n,s(i({title:"OpenAI > Article(s)",desc:"Article(s)",link:"/ai/openai/articles/README.md",logo:"/images/ico-wind.svg",background:"rgba(10,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),w,M,t(l,{name:"Master Multimodal Data Analysis with LLMs and Python",desc:"Large Language Models (LLMs) can be super helpful for advanced data analysis.
