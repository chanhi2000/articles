Operators are those little symbols like `+`, `*`, and `/`, and Swift uses them in a variety of ways depending on context ‚Äì a string plus another string equals a combined string, for example, whereas an integer plus another integer equals a summed integer.\n\nTo create your own operator you need to tell Swift whether it should be *prefix* (before its operand; the values used with it), *postfix* (after its operand), or *infix*. The most common is infix: `+`, `-`, `*`, and more are all infix.\n\nTo create a new operator, try adding this to a playground:\n\n```swift\ninfix operator **\n```\n\nThat‚Äôs the exponentiation operator, designed to raise one number to the power of another. Normally we‚Äôd use the `pow()` function for that job, but with operator overloading we can make `**` work instead.\n\nNow you need to tell Swift what to do when it sees that operator. For example, when we write something like `2 ** 4` what does that *mean*?\n\nWhat Swift wants is a function called `**`, the name of our operator, where the left-hand side is one type and the right-hand side is another type. Which type is down to us, but `**` is normally used with a `Double` on either side, so we‚Äôre going to write a function that accepts two doubles and returns a double:\n\n```swift\nfunc **(lhs: Double, rhs: Double) -> Double {\n    return pow(lhs, rhs)\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, the function itself is a cinch thanks to `pow()` ‚Äì we literally just pass on the numbers. Now this code should work in your playground:\n\n```swift\nlet result = 2 ** 4\n```\n\nFor more advanced uses, you also need to specify associativity and a precedence group, but what we have is fine to start with.\n\n"),y])}const _=s(d,[["render",b],["__file","how-to-use-operator-overloading.html.vue"]]),S=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-use-operator-overloading.html","title":"How to use operator overloading","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"How to use operator overloading","description":"Article(s) > How to use operator overloading","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-8.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > How to use operator overloading"},{"property":"og:description","content":"How to use operator overloading"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-use-operator-overloading.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-use-operator-overloading.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"How to use operator overloading"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > How to use operator overloading"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-8.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"How to use operator overloading\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.74,"words":521},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-use-operator-overloading.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{_ as comp,S as data};
