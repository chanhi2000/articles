One of the great features of SpriteKit's actions is that they can be chained together using action sequences. SpriteKit automatically ensures each action finishes before the next one begins ‚Äì all you need to do is create the actions then put them into an array.

The example below makes a spaceship shrink down to 10% of its original size before fading out:

\`\`\`swift
let sprite = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed:"Spaceship")

let scale = SKAction.scale(to: 0.1, duration: 0.5)
let fade = SKAction.fadeOut(withDuration: 0.5)
let sequence = SKAction.sequence([scale, fade])

sprite.run(sequence)
\`\`\`
