Yes, this will take some work, but there is no learning without struggle – all the challenges are completely within your grasp based on what you’ve learned so far.</p><p>For this project, your challenges are:</p><ul><li>Use Interface Builder to select the text label inside your table view cell and adjust its font size to something larger – experiment and see what looks good.</li><li>In your main table view, show the image names in sorted order, so “nssl0033.jpg” comes before “nssl0034.jpg”.</li><li>Rather than show image names in the detail title bar, show “Picture X of Y”, where Y is the total number of images and X is the selected picture’s position in the array. Make sure you count from 1 rather than 0.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="hints" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hints"><span>Hints</span></a></h2><p>It is <em>vital</em> to your learning that you try the challenges above yourself, and not just for a handful of minutes before you give up.</p><p>Every time you try something wrong, you learn that it’s wrong and you’ll remember that it’s wrong. By the time you find the <em>correct</em> solution, you’ll remember it much more thoroughly, while also remembering a lot of the wrong turns you took.</p><p>This is what I mean by “there is no learning without struggle”: if something comes easily to you, it can go just as easily. But when you have to really mentally fight for something, it will stick much longer.</p><p>But if you’ve already worked hard at the challenges above and are still struggling to implement them, I’m going to write some hints below that should guide you to the correct answer.</p><p><strong>If you ignore me and read these hints without having spent at least 30 minutes trying the challenges above, the only person you’re cheating is yourself.</strong></p><p>Still here?

We’ve covered sorting arrays previously, and you should remember there’s a <code>sort()</code> method you can use.</p><p>However, the question is: where should it be called? You <em>could</em> call this method each time you append an “nssl” picture to the <code>pictures</code> array, but that just causes extra work. Where could you put a call to <code>sort()</code> so its done only once, when the images have all been loaded?</p><p><strong>Rather than show image names in the detail title bar, show “Picture X of Y”, where Y is the total number of images and X is the selected picture’s position in the array.
