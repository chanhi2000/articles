It‚Äôs the job of a regular Swift initializer to create a fully fledged instance of a new type, however sometimes the data that has been provided is insufficient or incorrect, and creation can‚Äôt proceed.

For example, consider this code:

\`\`\`swift
struct Person {
    var ssn: String

    init(socialSecurityNumber: String) {
        self.ssn = socialSecurityNumber
    }
}

let person = Person(socialSecurityNumber: "111-11-1111")
print(person)
\`\`\`

That defines a \`Person\` struct that can be created using a nine-digit social security number, then creates an instance of that struct.

But what should happen here?

\`\`\`swift
let person = Person(socialSecurityNumber: "FISH")
\`\`\`

In that instance we‚Äôre passing an invalid social security number, so really we expect creating a \`Person\` to fail. 

This is where failable initializers come in: they are written as \`init?()\`, and can return nil rather than a value if something goes wrong during creation. For example, we could write a quick check to make sure the social security number is more or less correct like this:

\`\`\`swift
struct Person {
    var ssn: String

    init?(socialSecurityNumber: String) {
        if socialSecurityNumber.count < 11 {
            return nil
        } else {
            self.ssn = socialSecurityNumber
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

Notice the initializer is now called \`init?()\` to reflect that it returns an optional ‚Äì the process might return \`nil\` if the creation fails. The logic is pretty simple: if there are 11 digits we assume it‚Äôs correct, otherwise we return nil. Note: if you *really* wanted to validate that number you‚Äôd need to use a regular expression.
