knowledge to make sure you fully understand what‚Äôs going on:</p><ol><li>Add swipe to delete for sights.</li><li>Use an array of sort descriptors to initialize <code>DestinationListingView</code>, with the first sort being the one the user chose and the second sort being a sensible alternative ‚Äì arrival date then name, for example.</li><li>Add a second picker menu to the toolbar in <code>ContentView</code>, allowing the user to toggle showing all destinations or only ones that are in the future.</li></ol><p>Hacking with Swift+ subscribers can find the solutions to these three
