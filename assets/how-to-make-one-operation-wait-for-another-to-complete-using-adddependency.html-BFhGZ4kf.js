When working with multiple instances of \`Operation\`, you‚Äôll often want to queue up work that needs to be performed sequentially rather than all at once. If you want one operation to wait for another to complete before it starts, regardless of which operation queue either one is running on, you should use \`addDependency()\` to make the sequence clear to the system.

As an example, we could create two instances of \`BlockOperation\` that each print messages and pause a little:

\`\`\`swift
let operation1 = BlockOperation {
    print("Operation 1 is starting")
    Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 1)
    print("Operation 1 is finishing")
}

let operation2 = BlockOperation {
    print("Operation 2 is starting")
    Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 1)
    print("Operation 2 is finishing")
}
\`\`\`

If we added those directly to an operation queue, they would both start running immediately. However, we could tell \`operation2\` that it needs to wait for \`operation1\` to complete, like this:

\`\`\`swift
operation2.addDependency(operation1)
\`\`\`

Now if we add the operations to a queue they will execute sequentially rather than in parallel:

\`\`\`swift
print("Adding operations")
let queue = OperationQueue()
queue.addOperation(operation1)
queue.addOperation(operation2)
queue.waitUntilAllOperationsAreFinished()
print("Done!")
\`\`\`

You can add dependencies across operation queues if you need, which means you can queue up work to run in the background, then the main thread, then back to the background again without causing problems. So, we could rewrite the above code to run the operations on separate operation queues and we‚Äôd still get the same end result:

\`\`\`swift
print("Adding operations")
let queue1 = OperationQueue()
let queue2 = OperationQueue()
queue1.addOperation(operation1)
queue2.addOperation(operation2)
queue2.waitUntilAllOperationsAreFinished()
print("Done!")
\`\`\`
