You can make any \`UIViewController\` subclass respond to the device being shaken by overriding the \`motionBegan\` method. This is use to handle motion (shaking) but in theory also remote control actions ‚Äì although I can't say I've ever seen someone write code to handle that!

This code will print a message every time the device is shaken:

\`\`\`swift
override func motionBegan(_ motion: UIEvent.EventSubtype, with event: UIEvent?) {
    print("Device was shaken!")
}
\`\`\`
