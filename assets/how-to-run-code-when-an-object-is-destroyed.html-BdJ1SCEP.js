All structs and classes can have initializers, which are special methods that run when those types are created. However, classes can also have *deinitializers* ‚Äì code that gets run when an instance of the class is destroyed. This isn‚Äôt possible with structs because they only ever have one owner.

Deinitializers never take any parameters, so they are written just as \`deinit\`. For example, we could create a simple \`Person\` class with an initializer and a deinitializer:

\`\`\`swift
class Person {
    init() {
        print("I'm alive!")
    }

    deinit {
        print("I'm dying!")
    }
}
\`\`\`

If you want to try that in a playground, run this code:

\`\`\`swift
do {
    let person = Person()
}
\`\`\`

Putting the \`Person\` instance inside a \`do\` block ensures it will be destroyed before the playground finishes, so you should see ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alive!‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dying!‚Äù

Deinitializers are extremely important when handling memory that isn‚Äôt managed by Swift. For example, if you‚Äôre using an external C library and it has allocated RAM, you should free that RAM inside your deinitializer.
