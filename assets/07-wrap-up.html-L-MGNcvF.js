Can you find any objects that are persistent when they should have been destroyed?</li><li>For a tougher challenge, take the image generation code out of <code>cellForRowAt</code>: generate all images when the app first launches, and use those smaller versions instead. For bonus points, combine the <code>getDocumentsDirectory()</code> method I introduced in project 10 so that you save the resulting cache to make sure it never happens again.</li></ol><p>As a reminder, here‚Äôs the code for <code>getDocumentsDirectory()</code>:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">func</span> <span class="token function-definition function">getDocumentsDirectory</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">-&gt;</span> <span class="token constant">URL</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>
