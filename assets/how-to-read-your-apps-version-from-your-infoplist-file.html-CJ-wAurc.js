All iOS apps must store an app version number in their Info.plist file, but there‚Äôs no build-in way to get that as a string you can use in your code.

Fortunately, we can write a small extension to \`UIApplication\` that reads the Info.plist file and returns a version number automatically. This might not exist for some reason, so we‚Äôre going to make a static variable that returns an optional string in case there was a problem reading it.

Here‚Äôs the code:

\`\`\`swift
extension UIApplication {
    static var appVersion: String? {
        return Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: "CFBundleShortVersionString") as? String
    }
}
\`\`\`
