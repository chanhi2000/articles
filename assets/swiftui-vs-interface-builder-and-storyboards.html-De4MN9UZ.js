They might not <em>like</em> them, but they are at least <em>familiar</em> with them. If you haven&#39;t used these before, you should just skip this bit.</p><p>Still here? That means you&#39;ve used IB before and are probably curious how SwiftUI is different. Well, let me ask you this: have you ever edited a storyboard or XIB by hand?</p><p>Probably not. Well, apart from that one time once, but broadly the answer is <em>no</em> ‚Äì storyboards and XIBs contain a fairly large amount of XML that isn&#39;t easy to read or easy to edit.</p><p>Worse, storyboards have a habit of growing larger and larger over time. Sure, they might <em>start off</em> small, but then you add another view controller and another, and another, and suddenly you realize that you have ten screens of data in a single file, and any source control changes you make are suddenly quite painful.</p><p>But although being a single point of failure isn&#39;t great, and it&#39;s basically impossible to see what&#39;s changed when someone opens a pull request with a storyboard modification, storyboards and XIBs have a bigger problem.</p><p>You see, Interface Builder doesn&#39;t know much about our Swift code, and our Swift code doesn&#39;t know much about Interface Builder. As a result, we end up with lots of unsafe functionality: we <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-drag from IB into our code to connect something to an action, but if we then delete that action the code still compiles ‚Äì IB really doesn&#39;t mind if the code it intends to call no longer exists.</p><p>Similarly, when we create view controllers from a storyboard or dequeue table view cells, we use strings to identify important objects in our code ‚Äì a system so pervasive, it even has its own name: ‚Äústringly typed APIs‚Äù. Even then we need to use typecasts because Swift can&#39;t know that the table view cell it got back is actually a <code>MooncakeTableViewCell</code>.</p><p>These problems exist because IB and Swift are very separate things. This isn&#39;t a huge surprise ‚Äì not only does Interface Builder date from way before the original Mac OS X was a thing, but it&#39;s also very much designed around the way Objective-C works.</p>",9),k=t("p",null,"Anyway, we'll get onto exactly how SwiftUI works soon.
