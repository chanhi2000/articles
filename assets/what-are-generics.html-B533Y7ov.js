Generics are a way of making one data type act in a variety of ways depending on how it is created. You‚Äôve already used them whether you realized or not: Swift has an \`Array\` type, but it is *generic* ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt contain any sort of specific data. Instead, you ask for arrays that hold specific kinds of data by using things like \`[String]\` to get a string array.

It‚Äôs not hard to create generics of your own, and to demonstrate that we‚Äôre going to create a simple \`Queue\` type. These are first-in, first-out data structures (FIFO), which means you add things to the back and remove them from the front ‚Äì much like a real-life queue.

We want this queue to be generic, and in Swift you do that by writing the name of a generic placeholder inside angle brackets, like this: \`struct Queue<T> {\`. That \`T\` doesn‚Äôt mean anything special ‚Äì it could have been \`R\` or \`Element\` ‚Äì but \`T\` is commonly used.

Inside the queue we‚Äôre going to have an internal array tracking the items we‚Äôre storing, and we‚Äôll write methods to add and remove items.

Here‚Äôs the complete \`Queue\` struct:

\`\`\`swift
struct Queue<T> {
    private var internalArray = [T]()

    var count: Int {
        return internalArray.count
    }

    mutating func add(_ item: T) {
        internalArray.append(item)
    }

    mutating func remove() -> T? {
        if internalArray.count > 0 {
            return internalArray.removeFirst()
        } else {
            return nil
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

You can now create a queue to store any object you want. For example, this create a queue of integers:

\`\`\`swift
let queue = Queue<Int>()
\`\`\`
