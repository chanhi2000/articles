For example, you might create a `Student` class with properties such as `name` and `age`, then create a static `numberOfStudents` property that is owned by the `Student` class itself rather than individual instances.\n\nWhere `static` and `class` differ is how they support inheritance: When you make a `static` property it becomes owned by the class and cannot be changed by subclasses, whereas when you use `class` it may be overridden if needed.\n\nFor example, here‚Äôs a `Person` class with one static property and one class property:\n\n```swift\nclass Person {\n    static var count: Int {\n        return 250\n    }\n\n    class var averageAge: Double {\n        return 30\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf we created a `Student` class by inheriting from `Person`, trying to override `count` (the static property) would fail to compile if uncommented, whereas trying to override `averageAge` (the class property) is OK:\n\n```swift\nclass Student: Person {\n    // THIS ISN'T ALLOWED\n    // override static var count: Int {\n    //    return 150\n    // }\n\n    // THIS IS ALLOWED\n    override class var averageAge: Double {\n        return 19.5\n    }\n}\n```\n\n"),b])}const _=o(p,[["render",v],["__file","whats-the-difference-between-a-static-variable-and-a-class-variable.html.vue"]]),x=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/whats-the-difference-between-a-static-variable-and-a-class-variable.html","title":"What‚Äôs the difference between a static variable and a class variable?","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"What‚Äôs the difference between a static variable and a class variable?","description":"Article(s) > What‚Äôs the difference between a static variable and a class variable?","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-8.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > What‚Äôs the difference between a static variable and a class variable?"},{"property":"og:description","content":"What‚Äôs the difference between a static variable and a class variable?"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/whats-the-difference-between-a-static-variable-and-a-class-variable.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/whats-the-difference-between-a-static-variable-and-a-class-variable.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"What‚Äôs the difference between a static variable and a class variable?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > What‚Äôs the difference between a static variable and a class variable?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-8.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"What‚Äôs the difference between a static variable and a class variable?\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.62,"words":486},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/whats-the-difference-between-a-static-variable-and-a-class-variable.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{_ as comp,x as data};
