One of Swift‚Äôs lesser-known functions is \`prefix(while:)\`: call this on an array along with a test to apply, and it will return as many items from the start of the array as it can, stopping only when it reaches the first element that fails your test.

For example, if we had an array of test scores:

\`\`\`swift
let scores = [89, 86, 96, 78, 92, 100]
\`\`\`

We could use \`prefix(while:)\` to return all scores over 85 that occurred before the first score below 85 ‚Äì i.e., find me all the passing scores that took place before the first person failed.

Here‚Äôs that in Swift:

\`\`\`swift
let initialPasses1 = scores.prefix { $0 > 85 }
\`\`\`

You can apply any test you want, and sometimes you‚Äôll get back an empty array if the very first element fails your test. For example, this will return an empty array:

\`\`\`swift
let initialPasses2 = scores.prefix { $0 < 85 }
\`\`\`
