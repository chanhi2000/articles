But it&#39;s not perfect, I&#39;m afraid: first, you&#39;ll see GitHub commits get duplicated each time the app runs, and second you&#39;ll notice that tapping on a commit doesn’t do anything.</p><p>We&#39;ll be fixing that second problem later, but for now let&#39;s focus on the first problem: duplicate GitHub commits. In fact, you probably have triplicate or quadruplicate by now, because each time you run the app the same commits are fetched and added to Core Data, so you end up with the same data being repeated time and time again.</p><p>No one wants repeated data, so we&#39;re going to fix this problem. And for once I&#39;m pleased to say that Core Data makes this trivial thanks to a simple technology called &quot;unique constraints.&quot; All we need to do is find some data that is guaranteed to uniquely identify a commit, tell Core Data that is a unique identifier, and it will make sure objects with that same value don&#39;t get repeated.</p><p>Even better, Core Data can intelligently merge updates to objects in situations where this is possible. It&#39;s not going to happen with us, but imagine a situation where a commit author could retrospectively change their commit message from &quot;I fxed a bug with Swift&quot; to &quot;I fixed a bug with Swift.&quot; As long as the unique identifier didn&#39;t change, Core Data could recognize this was an update on the original commit, and merge the change intelligently.</p><p>In this app, we have the perfect unique attribute just waiting to be used: every commit has a &quot;sha&quot; attribute that is a long string of letters and numbers that identify that commit uniquely. SHA stands for &quot;secure hash algorithm&quot;, and it&#39;s used in many places to generate unique identifiers from content.</p><p>A &quot;hash&quot; is a little bit like like one-way, truncated encryption: one piece of input like &quot;Hello world&quot; will always generate the same hash, but if you change it to be &quot;Hello World&quot; – just capitalizing a single letter – you get a completely different hash. It&#39;s &quot;truncated&quot; because no matter how much content you give it as input, the &quot;sha&quot; will always be 40 letters. It&#39;s &quot;one way&quot; because you can&#39;t somehow reverse the hash to discover the original content, which is where hashes are different to encryption: an encrypted message can be decrypted to its original content, whereas a hashed message cannot be &quot;dehashed&quot; back to its original.</p><p>Hashes are frequently used as a checksum to verify that a file or data is correct: if you download a 10GB file and want to be sure it&#39;s exactly what the sender created, you can just compare your hash with theirs. Because hashes are truncated to a specific size, it is technically possible for two pieces of very different content to generate the same hash, known as a &quot;collision&quot;, but this is extremely rare.</p><p>Enough theory. Please go ahead and run your app a few times to make sure there are a good number of duplicates so you can see the problem in action. We added some <code>print()</code> statements in there for debugging purposes, so you&#39;ll see a message like this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token class-name">Got</span> <span class="token number">500</span> commits</span>
