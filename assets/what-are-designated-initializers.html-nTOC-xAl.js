Designated initializers are the default way of creating new instances of a type. There are others, known as convenience initializers, that are there to help you accomplish common tasks more easily, but those are in addition to your designated initializers rather than a replacement.

For example, you might create a \`Polygon\` class that stores sets of points to be drawn later on, like this:

\`\`\`swift
class Polygon {
    var points: [CGPoint]

    init(points: [CGPoint]) {
        self.points = points
    }
}
\`\`\`

That initializer is your designated initializer: one that will set up all properties fully in a default way. You could add convenience initializers on top to perform certain tasks ‚Äì creating squares or triangles would make sense in this scenario ‚Äì but those must always end by calling a designated initializer.
