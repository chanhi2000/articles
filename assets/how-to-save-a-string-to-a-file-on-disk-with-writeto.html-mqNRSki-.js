All strings have a \`write(to:)\` method that lets you save the contents of the string to disk. You need to provide a filename to write to, plus two more parameters: whether the write should be atomic, and what string encoding to use. The second parameter should nearly always be \`true\` because it avoids concurrency problems. The third parameter should nearly always be \`String.Encoding.utf8\`, which is pretty much the standard for reading and writing text.

Be warned: writing a string to disk can throw an exception, so you need to catch any errors and warn the user.

Here's the code:

\`\`\`swift
let str = "Super long string here"
let filename = getDocumentsDirectory().appendingPathComponent("output.txt")

do {
    try str.write(to: filename, atomically: true, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8)
} catch {
    // failed to write file ‚Äì bad permissions, bad filename, missing permissions, or more likely it can't be converted to the encoding
}
\`\`\`

That code uses a helper function called \`getDocumentsDirectory()\`, which finds the path to where you can save your app's files. Here it is:

\`\`\`swift
func getDocumentsDirectory() -> URL {
    let paths = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)
    return paths[0]
}
\`\`\`
