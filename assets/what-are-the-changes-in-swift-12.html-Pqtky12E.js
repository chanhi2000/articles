Its changes weren\'t big, but they did help clean up and clarify Swift, and helped tide us all over until the release of Swift 2.\n\nThe important changes are:\n\n- You can now check and unwrap multiple optionals using `if/let` rather than create a so-called "pyramid of doom" with nested statements.\n<li>Many Objective-C types that were being passed around now had correct nullability values set. This was done by modifying Objective-C then having many people scour through existing Apple code to add new annotations.\n<li>Downcasting (a typecast from a higher type in your class hierarchy to a lower type) is now done using `as!` and `as?` to mark forced downcasting and optional downcasting respectively.\n<li>Swift strings, arrays and dictionaries now no longer automatically typecast to `NSString`, `NSArray` and `NSDictionary`.\n<li>A new `Set` data type was introduced to handle arrays where each value can appear only once.\n<li>Constants can now be declared without a value, as long as they are provided with a value before they are used.\n<li>Incremental build support was added, which makes it more efficient to build larger Swift projects.\n\n'),y])}const v=r(p,[["render",S],["__file","what-are-the-changes-in-swift-12.html.vue"]]),x=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-are-the-changes-in-swift-12.html","title":"What are the changes in Swift 1.2?","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"What are the changes in Swift 1.2?","description":"Article(s) > What are the changes in Swift 1.2?","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-7.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > What are the changes in Swift 1.2?"},{"property":"og:description","content":"What are the changes in Swift 1.2?"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-are-the-changes-in-swift-12.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-are-the-changes-in-swift-12.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"What are the changes in Swift 1.2?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > What are the changes in Swift 1.2?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-7.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"What are the changes in Swift 1.2?\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.55,"words":465},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-are-the-changes-in-swift-12.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{v as comp,x as data};
