This configuration is provided to your model container to determine how it behaves.</li></ul><p>Every app that uses SwiftData needs to have at least one model container, so that the system knows where to read and write data. This container is usually placed on permanent storage (an iPhone‚Äôs SSD, for example), but might also be stored in memory so that it automatically gets cleared when the app terminates. If you‚Äôve used Core Data previously, this is the same as the <code>NSPersistentContainer</code>.</p><p>But not everything needs to be on disk at once. In fact, if we were always reading and writing every piece of data we were using, performance would be terrible. Instead, SwiftData prefers to read data from storage into memory then use it from there: when we load data using <code>@Query</code> or similar, it gets stored in this model context for fast access. We can then make a whole bunch of changes, and have them saved out to storage in one pass ‚Äì it‚Äôs a lot more efficient. Model contexts provide some extra functionality that is often useful, including the ability to undo or redo changes, and the ability to enable or disable autosave. If you‚Äôve used Core Data previously, this is the same as <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code>.</p><p>So, the model context stores all the in-memory objects and changes, and the model <em>container</em> stores it for long term.</p><p>Because all SwiftData apps must have at least one model container, you‚Äôll usually have code like this somewhere in your main <code>App</code> struct:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">modelContainer</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">for</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token class-name">YourModel</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token keyword">self</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>
