This is one of those things that sounds obvious in retrospect: \`AnyObject\` is Swift's way of saying, "I don't mind what type of object you pass in here, it could be a string, it could be a string, it could be a number, it could be an array, or it could be a custom type you defined yourself.

If you were wondering: the reason numbers work even though they clearly aren't objects is because Swift silently *makes* them objects when they need to conform to \`AnyObject\`. Magic!
