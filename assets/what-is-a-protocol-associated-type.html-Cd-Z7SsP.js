Associated types are a powerful way of making protocols generic, but they can be a bit confusing at first. In essence, they mark holes in protocols that must be filled by whatever types conform to those protocols.

Let‚Äôs start with a simple example: an \`ItemStoring\` protocol that can store items in an array. What *type* those items are depends on whatever conforms to the protocol, but we can still use them inside the protocol and any extensions.

Here‚Äôs the basic protocol:

\`\`\`swift
protocol ItemStoring {
    associatedtype DataType

    var items: [DataType] { get set}
    mutating func add(item: DataType)
}
\`\`\`

As you can see, it requires that conforming types provide an \`items\` array that holds an array of whatever is used to fill the \`DataType\` hole, and also a mutating method to add items of that type.

That mutating method is probably going to be the same for all conforming types, so we can write a protocol extension that provides a default implementation:

\`\`\`swift
extension ItemStoring {
    mutating func add(item: DataType) {
        items.append(item)
    }
}
\`\`\`

Finally we can create a \`NameDatabase\` struct that conforms to the \`ItemStoring\` protocol like this:

\`\`\`swift
struct NameDatabase: ItemStoring {
    var items = [String]()
}
\`\`\`

Swift is smart enough to realize that \`String\` is being used to fill the hole in the associated type, because the \`items\` array must be whatever \`DataType\` is.

That‚Äôs all the code written, so you can go ahead and use \`NameDatabase\`:

\`\`\`swift
var names = NameDatabase()
names.add(item: "James")
names.add(item: "Jess")
\`\`\`
