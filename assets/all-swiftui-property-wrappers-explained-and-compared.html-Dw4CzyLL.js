This is designed to store value types that are used locally by your view, so it’s great for storing integers, Booleans, and even local instances of structs.</p><p>In comparison, <code>@Binding</code> is used for simple data that you want to change, but is <em>not</em> owned by your view. As an example, think of how the built-in <code>Toggle</code> switch works: it needs to move between on and off states, but it doesn’t want to store that value itself so instead it has a binding to some external value that <em>we</em> own. So, our view has an <code>@State</code> property, and the <code>Toggle</code> has an <code>@Binding</code> property.</p><p>There is a variation of <code>@State</code> called <code>@GestureState</code>, specifically for tracking active gestures. This isn’t used so often, but it does have the benefit that it sets your property back to its initial value when the gesture ends.</p><p>For more advanced purposes – i.e., dealing with classes, or sharing data in many places – you should <em>not</em> use <code>@State</code> and <code>@Binding</code>. Instead, you should create your object somewhere using <code>@StateObject</code>, then use it in other views with <code>@ObservedObject</code>.</p><p><strong>A simple rule is this: if you see “state” in the name of a property wrapper, it means that views definitely owns the data.</strong></p><p>So, <code>@State</code> means simple value type data created and managed locally but perhaps shared elsewhere using <code>@Binding</code>, and <code>@StateObject</code> means reference type data created and managed locally, but perhaps shared elsewhere using something like <code>@ObservedObject</code>.</p><p>This is important: if you ever see <code>@ObservedObject var something = SomeType()</code> it should almost certainly be <code>@StateObject</code> instead so that SwiftUI knows the view should own the data rather than just refer to it elsewhere. Using <code>@ObservedObject</code> here can sometimes cause your app to crash because the object is destroyed prematurely.</p><p>If you find yourself handing the same data from view to view to view, you’ll find the <code>@EnvironmentObject</code> property wrapper useful. This lets you read a reference type object from a shared environment, rather than passing it around explicitly.</p><p>Just like <code>@ObservedObject</code>, <code>@EnvironmentObject</code> should <em>not</em> be used to create your object initially. Instead, create it in a different view and use the <code>environmentObject()</code> modifier to inject it into the environment. Although the environment will automatically keep ownership of your object, you can also use <code>@StateObject</code> to store it wherever it was originally created. This is <em>not</em> required, though: putting an object into the environment is enough to keep it alive without further ownership.</p><p>The final state-based property wrapper is <code>@Published</code>, which is used <em>inside</em> your reference types to annotate the properties. Any property marked with <code>@Published</code> will cause its parent class to announce that a change has occurred, which in turn will cause any view observing that object to make any changes it needs.</p><hr><h2 id="storing-long-term-data" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#storing-long-term-data"><span>Storing long-term data</span></a></h2><p>SwiftUI has three property wrappers designed to store and/or retrieve data.</p><p>The first is <code>@AppStorage</code>, which is a wrapper around <code>UserDefaults</code>. Every time you read or write a value from app storage, you’re actually reading or writing from <code>UserDefaults</code>.</p><p>The second is <code>@SceneStorage</code>, which is a wrapper around Apple’s state restoration APIs. State restoration is what allows an app to be closed and reloaded, and come back to the same state the user left off – it makes it look like our apps were always running, even though they were silently terminated.</p><p><strong><code>@AppStorage</code> and <code>@SceneStorage</code> are <em>not</em> secure and should <em>not</em> be used to store sensitive data.</strong></p><p>Although <code>@AppStorage</code> and <code>@SceneStorage</code> sound the same, they are not: <code>@AppStorage</code> stores one value for your entire application, whereas <code>@SceneStorage</code> will automatically save multiple values for the same data for times when the user has your app window open multiple times – think iPadOS and macOS.</p><p>So, you might use <code>@AppStorage</code> to store global values such as “what is the user’s high score?”, and you might use <code>@SceneStorage</code> to store “what page is the user reading right now?”</p><p>The third data property wrapper is <code>@FetchRequest</code>, which is used to retrieve information from Core Data. This will automatically use whichever managed object context is in the environment, and update itself when the underlying data has changed.</p><hr><h2 id="reading-environment-data" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reading-environment-data"><span>Reading environment data</span></a></h2><p>SwiftUI has two properties wrappers for reading the user’s environment: <code>@Environment</code> and <code>@ScaledMetric</code>.</p><p><code>@Environment</code> is used to read a wide variety of data such as what trait collection is currently active, whether they are using a 2x or 3x screen, what timezone they are on, and more. It also has a couple of special application actions, such as exporting files and opening a URL in the system-registered web browser.</p><p><code>@ScaledMetric</code> is much simpler, and lets us adapt the size of our user interface based on a user’s Dynamic Type settings. For example, a box that is 100x100 points might look great using the system default size, but with <code>@ScaledMetric</code> it will automatically become 200x200 when a larger Dynamic Type setting is enabled.</p><hr><h2 id="referring-to-views" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#referring-to-views"><span>Referring to views</span></a></h2><p>SwiftUI provides the <code>@Namespace</code> property wrapper, which creates a new namespace for animations. Animation namespaces let us say “animate views with an ID of 5”, and all views in that namespace with the ID 5 will be animated.</p><p>You can share namespaces between views by using the property type <code>Namespace.ID</code> and injecting the <code>@Namespace</code> value from whichever view created it. This allows you to created matched geometry effect animations across views, rather than storing all the data in the current view.</p><hr><h2 id="application-handling" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#application-handling"><span>Application handling</span></a></h2><p>If you ever need access to the old <code>UIApplicationDelegate</code> and <code>NSApplicationDelegate</code> methods and notifications, you should use the <code>@UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor</code> and <code>@NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor</code> property wrappers respectively.</p><p>You provide these with the class of your app delegate, and they will make sure an instance is created and sent all appropriate notifications.</p><hr><h2 id="sources-of-truth" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sources-of-truth"><span>Sources of truth</span></a></h2><p>Earlier I described which property wrappers own their data, and really this comes to sources of truth in your application: wrappers that own their data are sources of truth because they create and manage the value, and wrappers that do <em>not</em> own their data are <em>not</em> sources of truth because they get the value from somewhere else.</p><p><strong><em>Property wrappers that are sources of truth</em></strong></p><p>These create and manage values directly:</p><ul><li><code>@AppStorage</code></li><li><code>@FetchRequest</code></li><li><code>@GestureState</code></li><li><code>@Namespace</code></li><li><code>@NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor</code></li><li><code>@Published</code></li><li><code>@ScaledMetric</code></li><li><code>@SceneStorage</code></li><li><code>@State</code></li><li><code>@StateObject</code></li><li><code>@UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor</code></li></ul><p><strong><em>Property wrappers that are not sources of truth</em></strong></p><p>These get their values from somewhere else:</p><ul><li><code>@Binding</code></li><li><code>@Environment</code></li><li><code>@EnvironmentObject</code></li><li><code>@FocusedBinding</code></li><li><code>@FocusedValue</code></li><li><code>@ObservedObject</code></li></ul><hr><h2 id="if-you-remember-nothing-else" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#if-you-remember-nothing-else"><span>If you remember nothing else…</span></a></h2><p><strong>I want to make a new property owned by the current view.</strong> You should use <code>@State</code> for value types, and <code>@StateObject</code> for reference types.</p><p><strong>I want to refer to a value created elsewhere.</strong> You should use <code>@Binding</code> for value types, and either <code>@ObservedObject</code> or <code>@EnvironmentObject</code> for reference types.</p>',47),Z={class:"hint-container details"},J=e("summary",null,"Similar solutions…",-1);function W(c,X){const r=d("VPCard"),n=d("router-link"),i=d("RouteLink");return m(),h("div",null,[e("h1",f,[e("a",y,[e("span",null,u(c.$frontmatter.title)+" 관련",1)])]),o(r,s(l({title:"SwiftUI by Example",desc:"Back to Home",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/README.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),e("nav",b,[e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[o(n,{to:"#tl-dr"},{default:a(()=>[t("TL;DR")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[o(n,{to:"#storing-temporary-data"},{default:a(()=>[t("Storing temporary data")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[o(n,{to:"#storing-long-term-data"},{default:a(()=>[t("Storing long-term data")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[o(n,{to:"#reading-environment-data"},{default:a(()=>[t("Reading environment data")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[o(n,{to:"#referring-to-views"},{default:a(()=>[t("Referring to views")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[o(n,{to:"#application-handling"},{default:a(()=>[t("Application handling")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[o(n,{to:"#sources-of-truth"},{default:a(()=>[t("Sources of truth")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[o(n,{to:"#if-you-remember-nothing-else"},{default:a(()=>[t("If you remember nothing else…")]),_:1})])])]),v,o(r,s(l({title:"All SwiftUI property wrappers explained and compared | SwiftUI by Example",desc:"All SwiftUI property wrappers explained and compared",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/all-swiftui-property-wrappers-explained-and-compared",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),_,S,k,I,x,e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[A,t(" reads and writes values from "),U,t(".
