In comparison, UIKit and Auto Layout let us place things anywhere, so the system effectively had to make a best guess as to how things should be ordered.</p><p>SwiftUI also strongly encourages us to add labels to all our interactive controls, explicitly saying what everything is for. Yes, we can hide those labels, but even when they are hidden they are still used by the system as audio prompts for the screen reader and more.</p><p>So, SwiftUI gives us a lot of accessibility for free. However, it still gives us extra tools to provide a more enhanced experience: how should things be read by the screen reader? Does <em>everything</em> need to be read? What if the user prefers not to have fancy animations?</p><p>In this collection of chapters weâ€™re going to look at these more advanced pieces of functionality, hopefully helping you build user interfaces that provide users with a comfortable experience regardless of their system preferences.</p>",6),y={class:"hint-container details"},b=t("summary",null,"Similar solutionsâ€¦",-1);function k(a,I){const i=h("VPCard");return u(),c("div",null,[t("h1",w,[t("a",f,[t("span",null,r(a.$frontmatter.title)+" ê´€ë ¨",1)])]),e(i,o(s({title:"SwiftUI by Example",desc:"Back to Home",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/README.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),g,p,e(i,o(s({title:"Introduction to accessibility with SwiftUI | SwiftUI by Example",desc:"Introduction to accessibility with SwiftUI",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/introduction-to-accessibility-with-swiftui",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),m,t("details",y,[b,e(i,o(s({title:"How to detect the Reduce Motion accessibility setting | SwiftUI by Example",desc:"How to detect the Reduce Motion accessibility setting",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/how-to-detect-the-reduce-motion-accessibility-setting.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),e(i,o(s({title:"Introduction to using Core Data with SwiftUI | SwiftUI by Example",desc:"Introduction to using Core Data with SwiftUI",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/introduction-to-using-core-data-with-swiftui.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),e(i,o(s({title:"Introduction to navigation | SwiftUI by Example",desc:"Introduction to navigation",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/introduction-to-navigation.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),e(i,o(s({title:"Answering the big question: should you learn SwiftUI, UIKit, or both?
