We just released a course on the freeCodeCamp.org channel that will leach you how to build a full stack web app with React and Go. This comprehensive course is designed to teach you the fundamentals of Go while guiding you through the creation of a full stack web application. Throughout the course, you&#39;ll work with a variety of modern technologies, including React, TypeScript, MongoDB, TanStack Query, and ChakraUI.</p><p>In this project-based course, you&#39;ll build a fully functional web app with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for todos. The app will feature a stylish user interface with light and dark modes, ensuring a responsive design that looks great on any screen size. By the end of this course, you&#39;ll have a solid understanding of Go and React, along with hands-on experience in integrating various modern tools and libraries.</p><p>Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed for simplicity and performance. You&#39;ll learn how to set up a Go project, build APIs, and handle server-side logic. On the frontend, you&#39;ll use React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create the components of your application. The use of TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript, will help catch errors early and make the code more robust and maintainable.</p><p>For data storage, the course will guide you through integrating MongoDB, a NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability, with your Go APIs. You&#39;ll also use TanStack Query, a powerful tool for handling data fetching, caching, and updates in your React applications. This will help you manage server state and ensure your app performs efficiently. To create a stylish and responsive user interface, you&#39;ll utilize ChakraUI, a modern React component library that provides a set of accessible, reusable, and composable UI components.</p><hr><h2 id="course-contents" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#course-contents"><span>Course Contents</span></a></h2><p>Here are the sections in this course:</p><ul><li><strong>Intro &amp; Demo:</strong> Get an overview of the course and see a demo of the final project.</li><li><strong>Comparing to Node.js:</strong> Understand the differences between Go and Node.js and why you might choose Go for your projects.</li><li><strong>Project Setup:</strong> Set up your development environment and initialize your project.</li><li><strong>API without DB:</strong> Build the initial API endpoints without connecting to a database.</li><li><strong>API with DB:</strong> Integrate MongoDB to add persistent data storage to your API.</li><li><strong>UI Design:</strong> Design the frontend of your app using React and ChakraUI.</li><li><strong>Consume API from React:</strong> Learn how to make API calls from your React frontend.</li><li><strong>Configuration for Deployment:</strong> Prepare your app for deployment, ensuring it is production-ready.</li><li><strong>Deployment for Free:</strong> Deploy your app using free hosting services, making it accessible to the world.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></a></h2>',10),R={href:"https://youtu.be/lNd7XlXwlho",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function B(l,A){const n=a("VPCard"),r=a("router-link"),p=a("SiteInfo"),d=a("FontIcon"),h=a("VidStack");return y(),g("div",null,[e("h1",w,[e("a",k,[e("span",null,m(l.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),t(n,i(c({title:"Go > Article(s)",desc:"Article(s)",link:"/programming/go/articles/README.md",logo:"/images/ico-wind.svg",background:"rgba(10,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),t(n,i(c({title:"React.js > Article(s)",desc:"Article(s)",link:"/programming/js-react/articles/README.md",logo:"/images/ico-wind.svg",background:"rgba(10,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),e("nav",_,[e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(r,{to:"#course-contents"},{default:s(()=>[o("Course Contents")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[t(r,{to:"#conclusion"},{default:s(()=>[o("Conclusion")]),_:1})])])]),v,t(p,{name:"Learn the Basics of Go by Building a Full Stack Web App with React and Go",desc:"Go can work great on the backend for a React project.
