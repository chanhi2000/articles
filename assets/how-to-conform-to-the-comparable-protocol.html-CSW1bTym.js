Most of Swift‚Äôs built-in types support `Comparable` out of the box, but if you want your own type to conform to them then you need to implement `<` ‚Äì from that Swift can provide default implementations of the other three operators.\n\nThe `<` function needs to accept two instances of your type, one of the left-hand side and one on the right, and return true if the left-hand object should be ordered before the right-hand object.\n\nAs an example, consider this simple `Person` struct:\n\n```swift\nstruct Person {\n    var name: String\n}\n```\n\nThat has one property called `name`, and we‚Äôre going to make `Person` conform to the `Comparable` protocol based on that property. This means writing a static method called `<` that takes two instances of `Person` and internally compares the `name` properties of each of them:\n\n```swift\nstruct Person: Comparable {\n    var name: String\n\n    static func <(lhs: Person, rhs: Person) -> Bool {\n        return lhs.name < rhs.name\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith that in place you can now use `<` to compare two instances of `Person` like this:\n\n```swift\nlet taylor = Person(name: "Taylor Swift")\nlet justin = Person(name: "Justin Bieber")\nprint(taylor < justin)\n```\n\n'),b])}const C=c(m,[["render",y],["__file","how-to-conform-to-the-comparable-protocol.html.vue"]]),S=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-conform-to-the-comparable-protocol.html","title":"How to conform to the Comparable protocol","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"How to conform to the Comparable protocol","description":"Article(s) > How to conform to the Comparable protocol","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-8.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > How to conform to the Comparable protocol"},{"property":"og:description","content":"How to conform to the Comparable protocol"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-conform-to-the-comparable-protocol.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-conform-to-the-comparable-protocol.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"How to conform to the Comparable protocol"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > How to conform to the Comparable protocol"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-8.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"How to conform to the Comparable protocol\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.62,"words":486},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-conform-to-the-comparable-protocol.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{C as comp,S as data};
