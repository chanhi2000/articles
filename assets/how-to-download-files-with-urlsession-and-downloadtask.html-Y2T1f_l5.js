\`URLSession\` is designed to make network transfers as easy as possible, and a great example of that is its \`downloadTask\`()\` method. This fetches the contents of a URL you specify, saves it to a local file, then calls a completion handler so you can manipulate the file ‚Äì all in one.

To demonstrate this, here‚Äôs some code to download the source code to the apple.com homepage:

\`\`\`swift
let url = URL(string: "https://www.apple.com")!

let task = URLSession.shared.downloadTask(with: url) { localURL, urlResponse, error in
    if let localURL = localURL {
        if let string = try? String(contentsOf: localURL) {
            print(string)
        }
    }
}

task.resume()
\`\`\`

There are a few important things to note in there:

1. Your completion handler gets called with a local URL, which is where the data was saved locally. This is optional, so you need to unwrap it carefully.
<li>If something went wrong ‚Äì e.g. if the network was down ‚Äì then you‚Äôll get an error passed to you explaining what happened.
<li>When you have created your download task you should call \`resume()\` on it to make it happen.
<li>You don‚Äôt need to worry about storing the download task somewhere while it happens ‚Äì it‚Äôs being tracked by the shared \`URLSession\` on your behalf.
