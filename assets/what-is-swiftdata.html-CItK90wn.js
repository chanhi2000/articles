It lets us create custom objects, define how they link together, retrieve them with filtering and sorting, and even synchronize them to iCloud ‚Äì and much more too.</p><p>Not only does SwiftData take full advantage of the latest Swift language features, but it‚Äôs also built with SwiftUI in mind: if you‚Äôre building apps with SwiftUI, you‚Äôll find SwiftData slots in almost invisibly.</p><p>Behind the scenes, SwiftData is powered by a much bigger and more mature framework called Core Data. That brings all sorts of benefits, not least 20 years of development and maturity. But SwiftData is more than just a simple overlay: Apple really went to town in isolating and resolving the key pain points developers were reporting with the older framework, meaning that SwiftData is a significant improvement for anyone who has used Core Data in the past.</p><p>One downside is that SwiftData supports only iOS 17 or later, along with other coordinated releases ‚Äì that‚Äôs macOS Sonoma, tvOS 17, watchOS 10, and visionOS 1.0.</p><p>SwiftData makes a great choice for any kind of on-device storage, including:</p><ol><li>Permanent storage of user data, such as their to do lists or cooking recipes.</li><li>Temporary storage of user data, where SwiftData is used as a cache for data fetched from a server.</li><li>Document-based apps, e.g. text or video editors.</li><li>Complex user settings or history data.</li></ol><p>It‚Äôs <em>less</em> of a great choice when:</p><ol><li>You need to support many users using iOS 16 and earlier. Although SwiftData and Core Data can live side by side by in the same app, it‚Äôs extra work.</li><li>Your data is stored only in CloudKit or another equivalent service, and you need to be using live data at all times.</li><li>You need the full range of capabilities offered by Core Data. Many features from Core Data have yet to surface in SwiftData, so if you have more advanced use-cases you should probably stick with Core Data for now.</li></ol>",9);function y(s,S){const a=h("VPCard");return d(),n("div",null,[t("h1",f,[t("a",m,[t("span",null,l(s.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),e(a,i(o({title:"SwiftData by Example",desc:"Back to Home",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftdata/README.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),w,g,e(a,i(o({title:"What is SwiftData? | SwiftData by Example",desc:"What is SwiftData?",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftdata/what-is-swiftdata",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),u])}const v=r(p,[["render",y],["__file","what-is-swiftdata.html.vue"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftdata/what-is-swiftdata.html","title":"What is SwiftData?","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"What is SwiftData?","description":"Article(s) > What is SwiftData?","category":["Swift","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swiftdata","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > What is SwiftData?"},{"property":"og:description","content":"What is SwiftData?"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/swiftdata/what-is-swiftdata.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/swiftdata/what-is-swiftdata.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"What is SwiftData?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > What is SwiftData?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swiftdata"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2023-09-30T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"What is SwiftData?\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2023-09-30T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"prev":"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftdata/README.md","date":"2023-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.57,"words":471},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/swiftdata/what-is-swiftdata.md","localizedDate":"2023ÎÖÑ 9Ïõî 30Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{v as comp,D as data};
