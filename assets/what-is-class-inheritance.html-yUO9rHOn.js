This is used extensively on Apple platforms: `UIButton` inherits from `UIControl`, which inherits from `UIView`, which inherits from `UIResponder`, which inherits from `NSObject`, for example.\n\nThis approach allows you to create something new by building upon and tweaking existing functionality. If you want to create a custom view for your app, you don‚Äôt need to go all the way back to basics ‚Äì you can just inherit from `UIView` and make whatever changes you need. This means you automatically benefit from things like background colors, Auto Layout, `CALayer`, and more.\n\nWhile inheritance is both power and used extensively, it does create some problems. The main two are first that it‚Äôs available only with classes and so Swift‚Äôs structs and enums are excluded, and the second are that it creates tight coupling, where one piece of code depends heavily on another piece of code.\n\n"),y])}const v=c(d,[["render",b],["__file","what-is-class-inheritance.html.vue"]]),S=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-class-inheritance.html","title":"What is class inheritance?","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"What is class inheritance?","description":"Article(s) > What is class inheritance?","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-8.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > What is class inheritance?"},{"property":"og:description","content":"What is class inheritance?"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-class-inheritance.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-class-inheritance.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"What is class inheritance?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > What is class inheritance?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-8.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"What is class inheritance?\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.36,"words":408},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-class-inheritance.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{v as comp,S as data};
