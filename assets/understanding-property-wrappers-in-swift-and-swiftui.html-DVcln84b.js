For example, <code>@FetchRequest</code> expects you to have placed a Core Data managed object context into the environment ahead of time.</li><li>You may apply only one property wrapper at a time, which means <code>@ObservedObject @Binding var value = SomeClass()</code> is not allowed.</li><li>Even though some property wrappers look similar (looking at you, <code>@Environment</code> and <code>@EnvironmentObject</code>!) they are all different and itâ€™s important you use them appropriately.</li><li>You can create your own property wrappers if you want, but this isnâ€™t required to use SwiftUI.</li></ul><p>That covers the basics, but to really understand how these property wrappers work itâ€™s worth investigating them individually.</p>",6),y={class:"hint-container details"},b=t("summary",null,"Similar solutionsâ€¦",-1);function k(n,S){const e=l("VPCard");return d(),s("div",null,[t("h1",h,[t("a",f,[t("span",null,p(n.$frontmatter.title)+" ê´€ë ¨",1)])]),i(e,o(r({title:"SwiftUI by Example",desc:"Back to Home",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/README.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),u,m,i(e,o(r({title:"Understanding property wrappers in Swift and SwiftUI | SwiftUI by Example",desc:"Understanding property wrappers in Swift and SwiftUI",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/understanding-property-wrappers-in-swift-and-swiftui",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),g,t("details",y,[b,i(e,o(r({title:"All SwiftUI property wrappers explained and compared | SwiftUI by Example",desc:"All SwiftUI property wrappers explained and compared",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/all-swiftui-property-wrappers-explained-and-compared.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),i(e,o(r({title:"SwiftUI tips and tricks | SwiftUI by Example",desc:"SwiftUI tips and tricks",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/swiftui-tips-and-tricks.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),i(e,o(r({title:"How to use Instruments to profile your SwiftUI code and identify slow layouts | SwiftUI by Example",desc:"How to use Instruments to profile your SwiftUI code and identify slow layouts",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/how-to-use-instruments-to-profile-your-swiftui-code-and-identify-slow-layouts.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),i(e,o(r({title:"Building a menu using List | SwiftUI by Example",desc:"Building a menu using List",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/building-a-menu-using-list.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),i(e,o(r({title:"Answering the big question: should you learn SwiftUI, UIKit, or both?
