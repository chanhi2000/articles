However, <code>@EnvironmentObject</code> specifically means â€œthis object will be provided from some outside entity, rather than being created by the current view or specifically passed in.</p><p>In practical terms, imagine if you had view A, and view A had some data that view E wanted. Using <code>@ObservedObject</code> view A would need to hand the object to view B, which would hand it to view C, then view D, and finally view E â€“ all the intermediate views would need to be sent the object even though they didnâ€™t actually need it.</p><p>When using <code>@EnvironmentObject</code>, view A can create an object and place it into the environment. Any views inside it can then gain access to that environment object whenever they want just by asking for it, rather than having to pass it around explicitly â€“ it makes our code much simpler.</p><div class="hint-container warning"><p class="hint-container-title">Warning</p><p>When a view using <code>@EnvironmentObject</code> is shown, SwiftUI will immediately search the environment for an object of the correct type.

When you use <code>@EnvironmentObject</code> you are effectively promising that object will exist in the environment by the time it is needed, a bit like using implicitly unwrapped optionals.</p></div>`,11),g={class:"hint-container details"},f=e("summary",null,"Similar solutionsâ€¦",-1);function y(s,k){const t=l("VPCard");return h(),r("div",null,[e("h1",m,[e("a",w,[e("span",null,c(s.$frontmatter.title)+" ê´€ë ¨",1)])]),n(t,a(i({title:"SwiftUI by Example",desc:"Back to Home",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/README.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),u,b,n(t,a(i({title:"What is the @EnvironmentObject property wrapper?
