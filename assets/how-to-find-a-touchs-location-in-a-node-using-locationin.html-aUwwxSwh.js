It's just one line of code to find where the user touched the screen when you're using SpritKit, and that one line can even be used to calculative relative positions of a touch compared to any node in your game.

To get started, you should implement \`touchesBegan()\` in your SpriteKit node or scene. This will get called when the user starts touching the node, regardless of where on the node. To locate the exact position, call \`location(in:)\` on any \`UITouch\`, passing in the node you want to check, like this:

\`\`\`swift
override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
    if let touch = touches.first {
        let location = touch.location(in: self)
        print(location)
    }
}
\`\`\`
