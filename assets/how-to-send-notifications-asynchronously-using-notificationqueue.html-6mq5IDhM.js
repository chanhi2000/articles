Fortunately, Apple gives us an alternative in the shape of `NotificationQueue`: an asynchronous system that queues up notifications at different urgencies, and can even coalesce similar messages to avoid repetition.\n\nYou can try it out using this code:\n\n```swift\nlet notification = Notification(name: Notification.Name("MyValueChanged"))\nNotificationQueue.default.enqueue(notification, postingStyle: .whenIdle, coalesceMask: .none, forModes: nil)\n```\n\nThat will enqueue the ‚ÄúMyValueChanged‚Äù notification to be delivered when your app is idle, and without coalescing. You can also use `.asap` for your posting style to deliver in the next run loop, and `.now`, which will cause the notification to be delivered synchronously.\n\nThe reason the `.now` posting style is important is because of the ability of `NotificationQueue` to *coalesce* notifications ‚Äì i.e., join them together. If you specify `.onName` for the `coalesceMask` property it will automatically merge any notifications of the same name, which stops observers being overloaded by repeated notifications.\n\n'),w])}const v=c(d,[["render",b],["__file","how-to-send-notifications-asynchronously-using-notificationqueue.html.vue"]]),x=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-send-notifications-asynchronously-using-notificationqueue.html","title":"How to send notifications asynchronously using NotificationQueue","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"How to send notifications asynchronously using NotificationQueue","description":"Article(s) > How to send notifications asynchronously using NotificationQueue","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-5.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > How to send notifications asynchronously using NotificationQueue"},{"property":"og:description","content":"How to send notifications asynchronously using NotificationQueue"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/how-to-send-notifications-asynchronously-using-notificationqueue.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-send-notifications-asynchronously-using-notificationqueue.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"How to send notifications asynchronously using NotificationQueue"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > How to send notifications asynchronously using NotificationQueue"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-5.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2018-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"How to send notifications asynchronously using NotificationQueue\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2018-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2018-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.51,"words":453},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-send-notifications-asynchronously-using-notificationqueue.md","localizedDate":"2018ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{v as comp,x as data};
