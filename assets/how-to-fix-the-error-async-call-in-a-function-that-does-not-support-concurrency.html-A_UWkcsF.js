However, sometimes this can result in a bit of an ‚Äúasync infection‚Äù ‚Äì you mark one function as being async, which means its caller needs to be async too, as does *<code>its*</code> caller, and so on, until you‚Äôve turned one error into 50.</p><p>In this situation, you can create a dedicated <code>Task</code> to solve the problem.
