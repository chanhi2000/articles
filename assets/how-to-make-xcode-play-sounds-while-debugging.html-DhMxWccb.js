Xcode has lots of tools to help you debug user interface problems, but it‚Äôs a little tricker to debug things you can‚Äôt see ‚Äì network requests failing, data loading code going wrong, and so on.

A few years ago Markos Charatzas gave a <a href="https://qnoid.com/2013/06/08/Sound-Debugging.html">pioneering talk at NSConference</a> about the importance of using sound for debugging, and it‚Äôs a concept I‚Äôve since used in my own projects.

To try it out, place a breakpoint somewhere in your code, then right-click on it and choose ‚ÄúEdit Breakpoint‚Äù. Click the Add Action button, then change the action to be ‚ÄúSound‚Äù ‚Äì you‚Äôll see a list of system sounds you can choose from.

It doesn‚Äôt matter which sound you choose (although having sad sounds for failures does help!), but no matter what you decide you should check the box below marked ‚ÄúAutomatically continue after evaluating actions‚Äù ‚Äì this will ensure your breakpoint doesn‚Äôt stop execution of the program.

That checkbox plus the sound together means your program won‚Äôt pause when your breakpoints are hit, but will instead almost become musical: as network operations start, succeed, or fail, you‚Äôll hear beeps, clicks, and bongs from your Mac so you‚Äôll know exactly what‚Äôs happening just by listening.

**Note:** In case you were worried, none of these sounds will actually play when your app ships ‚Äì they are just used by Xcode‚Äôs debugging engine.
