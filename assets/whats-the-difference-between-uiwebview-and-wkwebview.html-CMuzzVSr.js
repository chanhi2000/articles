First, `UIWebView` is part of UIKit, and thus is available to your apps as standard. You don't need to import anything ‚Äì it's just there. This also means it's available inside Interface Builder, so you can drag and drop web view into your designs.\n\nSecond, `WKWebView` is run in a separate process to your app so that it can draw on native Safari JavaScript optimizations. This means `WKWebView` loads web pages faster and more efficiently than `UIWebView`, and also doesn't have as much memory overhead for you.\n\nIn iOS 8.0 `WKWebView` was unable to load local files, but this got fixed in iOS 9.0. The main reason to use `UIWebView` nowadays is for access to older features such as \"Scale pages to fit\" - this is not available in `WKWebView`.\n\n"),W])}const y=s(h,[["render",g],["__file","whats-the-difference-between-uiwebview-and-wkwebview.html.vue"]]),_=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/wkwebview/whats-the-difference-between-uiwebview-and-wkwebview.html","title":"What's the difference between UIWebView and WKWebView","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"What's the difference between UIWebView and WKWebView","description":"Article(s) > What's the difference between UIWebView and WKWebView","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-8.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > What's the difference between UIWebView and WKWebView"},{"property":"og:description","content":"What's the difference between UIWebView and WKWebView"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/wkwebview/whats-the-difference-between-uiwebview-and-wkwebview.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/wkwebview/whats-the-difference-between-uiwebview-and-wkwebview.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"What's the difference between UIWebView and WKWebView"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > What's the difference between UIWebView and WKWebView"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-8.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"What's the difference between UIWebView and WKWebView\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.47,"words":442},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/wkwebview/whats-the-difference-between-uiwebview-and-wkwebview.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}`);export{y as comp,_ as data};
