For example, here is an array of wizards:\n\n```swift\nlet wizards1 = ["Harry", "Ron", "Hermione"]\n```\n\nAnd here‚Äôs a matching array of the animals owned by those wizards:\n\n```swift\nlet animals1 = ["Hedwig", "Scabbers", "Crookshanks"]\n```\n\nUsing `zip()` we can combine them together:\n\n```swift\nlet combined1 = zip(wizards1, animals1)\n```\n\nThat will produce a single sequence combining the earlier two. To avoid doing extra work, Swift actually creates a special type called `Zip2Sequence` that stores both sequences internally ‚Äì this is more efficient than doing the actual joining, but it does make the output harder to read if you‚Äôre using a playground. So, if you *are* using a playground you should wrap the output from `zip()` into a new array to make its output easier to read:\n\n```swift\nlet combined2 = Array(zip(wizards1, animals1))\n```\n\nIf you print `combined` you‚Äôll see it contains this array:\n\n```swift\n[("Harry", "Hedwig"), ("Ron", "Scabbers"), ("Hermione", "Crookshanks")]\n```\n\nOne of the helpful features of `zip()` is that if your two arrays differ in size it will automatically choose the shorter of the two. This avoids trying to read two arrays at the same time and accidentally going out of bounds when one is shorter.\n\nFor example, this code will print out the animals belonging to the first three wizards, but nothing for Draco because he doesn‚Äôt have a matching animal:\n\n```swift\nlet wizards2 = ["Harry", "Ron", "Hermione", "Draco"]\nlet animals2 = ["Hedwig", "Scabbers", "Crookshanks"]\n\nfor (wizard, animal) in zip(wizards2, animals2) {\n    print("\\(wizard) has \\(animal)")\n}\n```\n\n'),y])}const H=s(u,[["render",b],["__file","how-to-use-the-zip-function-to-join-two-arrays.html.vue"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-use-the-zip-function-to-join-two-arrays.html","title":"How to use the zip() function to join two arrays","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"How to use the zip() function to join two arrays","description":"Article(s) > How to use the zip() function to join two arrays","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-8.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > How to use the zip() function to join two arrays"},{"property":"og:description","content":"How to use the zip() function to join two arrays"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-use-the-zip-function-to-join-two-arrays.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-use-the-zip-function-to-join-two-arrays.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"How to use the zip() function to join two arrays"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > How to use the zip() function to join two arrays"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-8.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"How to use the zip() function to join two arrays\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.82,"words":547},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-use-the-zip-function-to-join-two-arrays.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{H as comp,j as data};
