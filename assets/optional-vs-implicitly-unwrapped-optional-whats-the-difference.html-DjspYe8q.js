Here‚Äôs a quick summary that should explain the difference:\n\nWhen you use `String` you‚Äôre saying this will always have a string inside, and can never have nothing inside. It might be an empty string (`""`), but even an empty string is still a string.\n\nWhen you use `String?` you‚Äôre saying this might have a string inside, but it might have nothing at all inside ‚Äì not even an empty string. Swift won‚Äôt let you use these without unwrapping them, which is usually done using `if let`.\n\nWhen you use `String!` you‚Äôre saying this might have a string inside, but it might have nothing at all inside ‚Äì not even an empty string. However, Swift lets you use these as if they were a `String`, as if they always *do* have a value, but if you try to use a nil value by accident your code will crash. This effectively lets you say ‚ÄúI know this *might* be nil, but I‚Äôm so sure it has a value that I‚Äôm willing for my program to crash if I‚Äôm wrong.‚Äù\n\nSo: `String` is definitely a string, `String?` might be nil or might be a string, and `String!` might be nil but when you use it you‚Äôre absolutely sure it has a string.\n\n'),y])}const k=r(g,[["render",v],["__file","optional-vs-implicitly-unwrapped-optional-whats-the-difference.html.vue"]]),x=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/optional-vs-implicitly-unwrapped-optional-whats-the-difference.html","title":"Optional vs implicitly unwrapped optional: what‚Äôs the difference?","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Optional vs implicitly unwrapped optional: what‚Äôs the difference?","description":"Article(s) > Optional vs implicitly unwrapped optional: what‚Äôs the difference?","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-8.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > Optional vs implicitly unwrapped optional: what‚Äôs the difference?"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Optional vs implicitly unwrapped optional: what‚Äôs the difference?"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/optional-vs-implicitly-unwrapped-optional-whats-the-difference.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/optional-vs-implicitly-unwrapped-optional-whats-the-difference.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Optional vs implicitly unwrapped optional: what‚Äôs the difference?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > Optional vs implicitly unwrapped optional: what‚Äôs the difference?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-8.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Optional vs implicitly unwrapped optional: what‚Äôs the difference?\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.65,"words":495},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/optional-vs-implicitly-unwrapped-optional-whats-the-difference.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{k as comp,x as data};
