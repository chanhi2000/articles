You‚Äôll often see it written as `?:` but in practice the `?` and `:` are used separately.\n\nLike I said, the ternary operator is used with three values: the check to run, what to return if the check is true, and what to return if the check is false. For example, if we had a `score` constant that contained an integer, we could make a `result` constant equal either to ‚ÄúPass‚Äù or ‚ÄúFail‚Äù depending on the value of `score`:\n\n```swift\nlet score = 88\nlet result = score > 85 ? "Pass" : "Fail"\n```\n\nYou can read that ternary as ‚Äúif score is greater than 85 return Pass otherwise return Fail.‚Äù Because `score` was set to 88, `result` will be set to Pass.\n\nThe ternary operator usually makes your code harder to read and understand, so it doesn‚Äôt get much use.\n\n'),y])}const v=s(d,[["render",k],["__file","what-is-the-ternary-operator.html.vue"]]),S=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-the-ternary-operator.html","title":"What is the ternary operator?","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"What is the ternary operator?","description":"Article(s) > What is the ternary operator?","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-8.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > What is the ternary operator?"},{"property":"og:description","content":"What is the ternary operator?"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-the-ternary-operator.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-the-ternary-operator.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"What is the ternary operator?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > What is the ternary operator?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-8.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"What is the ternary operator?\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.34,"words":403},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-the-ternary-operator.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{v as comp,S as data};
