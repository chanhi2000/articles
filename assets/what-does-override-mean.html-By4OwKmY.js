It's used commonly when you're working with `UIViewControllers`, because view controllers already come with lots of methods like `viewDidLoad()` and `viewWillAppear()`. When you want to override these default methods, you need to specify this with the `override` keyword.\n\nNow, you might be wondering why the `override` keyword is even needed, but it's really about ensuring your code is safe ‚Äì if you write a method and accidentally name it the same as something that already exists, Xcode will simply refuse to build your app until you add in the `override` keyword.
