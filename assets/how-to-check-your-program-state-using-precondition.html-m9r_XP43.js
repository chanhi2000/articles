One of the neat features of `assert()` is that it automatically gets removed when you build your app in release mode, but if you don‚Äôt want that to happen ‚Äì if you want your app to crash if something is seriously wrong ‚Äì then you should use the `precondition()` function instead.\n\n`precondition()` works identically to `assert()`: give it a condition to check along with an optional message to print if the check fails. At runtime ‚Äì even in release mode ‚Äì Swift will run the check for you and crash if the check fails.\n\nFor example:\n\n```swift\nprecondition(users.count > 0, "There must be at least one user.")\n```\n\nWhereas `assert()` should be used liberally to make sure your program is always in a sane state, `precondition()` should be used much more infrequently because it will still crash your app in release mode. That‚Äôs not always a bad thing, particularly if bad state means something is seriously corrupted, but you should definitely use it more carefully.\n\n'),f])}const v=s(u,[["render",k],["__file","how-to-check-your-program-state-using-precondition.html.vue"]]),S=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-check-your-program-state-using-precondition.html","title":"How to check your program state using precondition()","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"How to check your program state using precondition()","description":"Article(s) > How to check your program state using precondition()","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-8.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > How to check your program state using precondition()"},{"property":"og:description","content":"How to check your program state using precondition()"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-check-your-program-state-using-precondition.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-check-your-program-state-using-precondition.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"How to check your program state using precondition()"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > How to check your program state using precondition()"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-8.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"How to check your program state using precondition()\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.52,"words":455},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/how-to-check-your-program-state-using-precondition.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{v as comp,S as data};
