Optimizing your application‚Äôs launch time helps ensure users spend more time using your app and less time staring at your launch screen, and helpfully Xcode comes with a built-in way to help us measure and monitor that time: \`XCTOSSignpostMetric.applicationLaunch\`.

To use this, start a new \`measure()\` block, asking for that value as one of the metrics you want to track. Given that is focusing specifically on launch time, it‚Äôs probably a good idea to ask for that single metric. When you‚Äôre ready, call \`XCUIApplication().launch()\` to launch your app, like this:

\`\`\`swift
func testLaunchPerformance() {
    measure(metrics: [XCTOSSignpostMetric.applicationLaunch]) {
        XCUIApplication().launch()
    }
}
\`\`\`

Like a regular \`measure()\` block, this causes your test to be run multiple times to ensure a fair spread of readings. When it finishes, you‚Äôll be able to set the baseline for your launch time, to make sure changes made in the future don‚Äôt dramatically affect it.

Although Apple doesn‚Äôt specify a precise number of seconds that we should aim for with app open times, they *do* say ‚Äúa low number of seconds‚Äù. Based on my experience, anything more than three seconds on the newest device will feel slow, particularly because it‚Äôs likely to be five or more seconds on older devices.

**Tip:** If you create a new UI Test target you‚Äôll get an application launch test included in the template.
