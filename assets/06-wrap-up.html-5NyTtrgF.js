When this is tapped, show an alert telling users the data comes from the We The People API of the Whitehouse.</li><li>Let users filter the petitions they see. This involves creating a second array of filtered items that contains only petitions matching a string the user entered. Use a <code>UIAlertController</code> with a text field to let them enter that string. This is a tough one, so I‚Äôve included some hints below if you get stuck.</li><li>Experiment with the HTML ‚Äì this isn‚Äôt a HTML or CSS tutorial, but you can find lots of resources online to give you enough knowledge to tinker with the layout a little.</li></ol><hr><h2 id="hints" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hints"><span>Hints</span></a></h2><p>It is <em>vital</em> to your learning that you try the challenges above yourself, and not just for a handful of minutes before you give up.</p><p>Every time you try something wrong, you learn that it‚Äôs wrong and you‚Äôll remember that it‚Äôs wrong. By the time you find the <em>correct</em> solution, you‚Äôll remember it much more thoroughly, while also remembering a lot of the wrong turns you took.</p><p>This is what I mean by ‚Äúthere is no learning without struggle‚Äù: if something comes easily to you, it can go just as easily. But when you have to really mentally fight for something, it will stick much longer.</p><p>But if you‚Äôve already worked hard at the challenges above and are still struggling to implement them, I‚Äôm going to write some hints below that should guide you to the correct answer.</p><p><strong>If you ignore me and read these hints without having spent at least 30 minutes trying the challenges above, the only person you‚Äôre cheating is yourself.</strong></p><p>Still here? OK. The second challenge here is to let users filter the petitions they see. To solve this you need to do a number of things:</p><ol><li>Have one property to store all petitions, and one to store filtered petitions. This means the user can filter the petitions several times and you don‚Äôt have to keep redownloading your JSON.</li><li>At first your filtered petitions array will be the same as the main petitions array, so just assign one to the other when your data is ready.</li><li>Your table view should load all its data from the filtered petitions array.</li><li>You‚Äôll need a bar button item to show an alert controller that the user can type into.</li><li>Once that‚Äôs done, go through all the items in your petitions array, adding any you want to the filtered petition.</li></ol><p>The important part here is the last one: how do you decide whether a petition matches the user‚Äôs search? One option is to use <code>contains()</code> to check whether the petition title or body text contains the user‚Äôs search string ‚Äì try it and see how you get on!</p>',14);function T(h,A){const i=l("VPCard"),a=l("router-link"),c=l("VidStack");return m(),p("div",null,[e("h1",y,[e("a",f,[e("span",null,d(h.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),t(i,n(r({title:"Hacking with iOS ‚Äì learn to code iPhone and iPad apps with free Swift tutorials",desc:"Learn Swift coding for iOS with these free tutorials ‚Äì learn Swift, iOS, and Xcode",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/read/README.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),e("nav",k,[e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(a,{to:"#review-what-you-learned"},{default:s(()=>[o("Review what you learned")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[t(a,{to:"#challenge"},{default:s(()=>[o("Challenge")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[t(a,{to:"#hints"},{default:s(()=>[o("Hints")]),_:1})])])]),b,t(i,n(r({title:"Wrap up | Hacking with iOS",desc:"Wrap up",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/read/7/6/wrap-up",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),t(c,{src:"youtube/utUpNqglZGs"}),v,_,S,x,I,W,t(i,n(r({title:"Review ‚Äì Project 7: Whitehouse Petitions ‚Äì Hacking with Swift",desc:"Interactive tests that help gauge your progress learning Swift",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/review/hws/project-7-whitehouse-petitions",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),O])}const P=u(w,[["render",T],["__file","06-wrap-up.html.vue"]]),B=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/read/07/06-wrap-up.html","title":"Wrap up","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Wrap up","description":"Article(s) > Wrap up","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","xcode","appstore","ios"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > Wrap up"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Wrap up"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/read/07/06-wrap-up.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/read/07/06-wrap-up.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Wrap up"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > Wrap up"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Wrap up\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"next":"/hackingwithswift.com/read/08/overview.md","isOriginal":false},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Review what you learned","slug":"review-what-you-learned","link":"#review-what-you-learned","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Challenge","slug":"challenge","link":"#challenge","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Hints","slug":"hints","link":"#hints","children":[]}],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":2.78,"words":834},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/read/07/06-wrap-up.md","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{P as comp,B as data};
