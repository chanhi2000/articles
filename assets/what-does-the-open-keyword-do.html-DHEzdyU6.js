That is, someone can be public for folks to use, but not public for them to extend.\n\nHere‚Äôs an example to demonstrate the difference:\n\n```swift\nopen class User {\n    open func login() { }\n    public func playGame() { }\n    public init() { }\n}\n```\n\nIf that were defined in its own module, any other code accessing it would be able to inherit from the `User` class because it‚Äôs marked `open`. Inside the child class, they could override `login()` because it‚Äôs also marked `open`, but they could *not* override `playGame()` because it‚Äôs marked only as `public` ‚Äì it can be *called*, but not *changed*. If you remove `open` from the whole `User` class it can be *used* but not *subclassed*.\n\nThe `open` keyword is an effective way of stopping other developers from accidentally overriding functionality that‚Äôs critical to the way your app works. If you use it selectively, subclassers can add their own functionality or perhaps replace a few non-critical components, without altering the fundamental behavior of your class.\n\n"),y])}const v=s(p,[["render",k],["__file","what-does-the-open-keyword-do.html.vue"]]),S=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-does-the-open-keyword-do.html","title":"What does the open keyword do?","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"What does the open keyword do?","description":"Article(s) > What does the open keyword do?","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-8.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > What does the open keyword do?"},{"property":"og:description","content":"What does the open keyword do?"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-does-the-open-keyword-do.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-does-the-open-keyword-do.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"What does the open keyword do?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > What does the open keyword do?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-8.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"What does the open keyword do?\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.5,"words":451},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-does-the-open-keyword-do.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{v as comp,S as data};
