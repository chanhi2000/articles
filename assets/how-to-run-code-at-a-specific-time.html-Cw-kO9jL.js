This class is great for executing code repeatedly at a specific time interval, but it's also great for running code at an exact time that you specify.\n\nThis is accomplished using a `Timer` constructor that accepts an `Date` for when the timer should fire. You can make this date however you want, which is what makes this approach so flexible.\n\nAs a simple example, this will create a timer that calls a `runCode()` method in five seconds:\n\n```swift\nlet date = Date.now.addingTimeInterval(5)\nlet timer = Timer(fireAt: date, interval: 0, target: self, selector: #selector(runCode), userInfo: nil, repeats: false)\nRunLoop.main.add(timer, forMode: .common)\n```\n\nNotice how you can specify a `interval` parameter? That's for when you set `repeats` to be `true`. If you have a `Date` 5 seconds from now and an `interval` of 1 (after setting `repeat` to be true!), it means \"call `runCode()` after five seconds, then every one second after that.\"\n\n"),y])}const v=r(d,[["render",k],["__file","how-to-run-code-at-a-specific-time.html.vue"]]),S=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-run-code-at-a-specific-time.html","title":"How to run code at a specific time","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"How to run code at a specific time","description":"Article(s) > How to run code at a specific time","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-2.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > How to run code at a specific time"},{"property":"og:description","content":"How to run code at a specific time"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/how-to-run-code-at-a-specific-time.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-run-code-at-a-specific-time.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"How to run code at a specific time"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > How to run code at a specific time"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-2.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2022-03-23T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"How to run code at a specific time\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2022-03-23T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2022-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.61,"words":483},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-run-code-at-a-specific-time.md","localizedDate":"2022ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 23Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{v as comp,S as data};
