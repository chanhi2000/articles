In terms of performance, this is <em>not</em> free: synchronous and asynchronous functions use a different calling convention internally, with the asynchronous variant being slightly less efficient.</p><p>The important thing to understand here is that Swift cannot tell at compile time whether an <code>await</code> call will suspend or not, and so the same (slightly) more expensive calling convention is used regardless of what actually takes place at runtime.</p><p>However, what happens at runtime depends on whether the call suspends or not:</p><ul><li>If a suspension happens, then Swift will pause the function and all its callers, which has a small performance cost. These will then be resumed later, and ultimately whatever performance cost you pay for the suspension is like a rounding error compared to the performance gain provided by async/await even existing.</li><li>If a suspension does <em>not</em> happen, no pause will take place and your function will continue to run with the same efficiency and timings as a synchronous function.</li></ul><p>That last part carries an important side effect: using <code>await</code> will not cause your code to wait for one runloop to go by before continuing.</p><p>It‚Äôs a common joke that many coding problems can be fixed by waiting for one runloop tick to pass before trying again ‚Äì usually seen as <code>DispatchQueue.main.async { ‚Ä¶ }</code> in Swift projects ‚Äì but that will <em>not</em> happen when using <code>await</code>, because the code will execute immediately.</p><p>So, if your code doesn‚Äôt actually suspend, the only cost to calling an asynchronous function is the slightly more expensive calling convention, and if your code <em>does</em> suspend then any cost is more or less irrelevant because you‚Äôve gained so much extra performance thanks to the suspension happening in the first place.</p>",8),w={class:"hint-container details"},k=t("summary",null,"Similar solutions‚Ä¶",-1);function b(c,v){const n=h("VPCard");return f(),s("div",null,[t("h1",u,[t("a",m,[t("span",null,r(c.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),e(n,o(a({title:"Swift Concurrency by Example",desc:"Back to Home",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/concurrency/README.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),g,y,e(n,o(a({title:"What‚Äôs the performance cost of calling an async function?
