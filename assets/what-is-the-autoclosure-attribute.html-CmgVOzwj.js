The \`@autoclosure\` attribute can be applied to a closure parameter for a function, and automatically creates a closure from an expression you pass in. When you call a function that uses this attribute, the code you write *isn't* a closure, but it *becomes* a closure, which can be a bit confusing ‚Äì even the official Swift reference guide warns that overusing autoclosures makes your code harder to understand.

To help you understand how it works, here's a trivial example:

\`\`\`swift
func printTest1(_ result: () -> Void) {
    print("Before")
    result()
    print("After")
}

printTest1({ print("Hello") })
\`\`\`

That code creates a \`printTest()\` method, which accepts a closure and calls it. As you can see, the \`print("Hello")\` is inside a closure that gets called between "Before" and "After", so the final output is "Before", "Hello", "After".

If we used \`@autoclosure\` instead, it would allow us to rewrite the \`printTest()\` call so that it doesn't need braces, like this:

\`\`\`swift
func printTest2(_ result: @autoclosure () -> Void) {
    print("Before")
    result()
    print("After")
}

printTest2(print("Hello"))
\`\`\`

These two pieces of code produce identical results thanks to \`@autoclosure\`. In the second code example, the \`print("Hello")\` won't be executed immediately because it gets wrapped inside a closure for execution later.

The \`@autoclosure\` attribute is used inside Swift wherever code needs to be passed in and executed only if conditions are right. For example, the \`&&\` operator uses \`@autoclosure\` to allow short-circuit evaluation, and the \`assert()\` function uses it so that the assertion isn‚Äôt checked outside of debug mode.
