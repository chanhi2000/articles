UIKit has a built-in view controller designed to let the user take photos, crop them as needed, them load them directly into your app. Even better, it only takes a few lines of code to use!

First, make your view controller conform to both \`UINavigationControllerDelegate\`, and \`UIImagePickerControllerDelegate\`.

Second, add this code wherever you want to trigger the camera process:

\`\`\`swift
let vc = UIImagePickerController()
vc.sourceType = .camera
vc.allowsEditing = true
vc.delegate = self
present(vc, animated: true)
\`\`\`

The \`sourceType\` property is what directs the view controller to the camera rather than the user‚Äôs saved image library.

Third, add the \`didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo\` method, which gets called by the image picker when an image was selected. You need to read it out of the info dictionary using the key \`.editedImage\`, but then you have a \`UIImage\` that you can do whatever you want with.

This example code should get you started:

\`\`\`swift
func imagePickerController(_ picker: UIImagePickerController, didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo info: [UIImagePickerController.InfoKey : Any]) {
    picker.dismiss(animated: true)

    guard let image = info[.editedImage] as? UIImage else {
        print("No image found")
        return
    }

    // print out the image size as a test
    print(image.size)
}
\`\`\`

That‚Äôs all the code needed to make the camera work, but there is one last change you need: reading images from the camera requires a new Info.plist key describing how you plan to use the data.

To add this, open your Info.plist file, right-click on some space below the rows, then choose Add Row. Give it the name ‚ÄúPrivacy - Camera Usage Description‚Äù, then enter a description in the value area ‚Äì this will be shown to users the first time you try to use the camera.
