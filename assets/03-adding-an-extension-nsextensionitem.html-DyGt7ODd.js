We only care about this first item in this project, and even then it might not exist, so we conditionally typecast using <code>if let</code> and <code>as?</code>.</li><li>Our input item contains an array of attachments, which are given to us wrapped up as an <code>NSItemProvider</code>. Our code pulls out the first attachment from the first input item.</li><li>The next line uses <code>loadItem(forTypeIdentifier: )</code> to ask the item provider to actually provide us with its item, but you&#39;ll notice it uses a closure so this code executes asynchronously. That is, the method will carry on executing while the item provider is busy loading and sending us its data.</li><li>Inside our closure we first need the usual <code>[weak self]</code> to avoid strong reference cycles, but we also need to accept two parameters: the dictionary that was given to us by the item provider, and any error that occurred.</li><li>With the item successfully pulled out, we can get to the interesting stuff: working with the data. We have <code>// do stuff!</code> right now, but it&#39;ll be more interesting later, I promise.</li></ul><p>This code takes a number of shortcuts that Apple&#39;s own code doesn&#39;t, which is why it&#39;s significantly shorter. Once you&#39;ve gotten to grips with this basic extension, I do recommend you go back and look at Apple&#39;s template code to see how it loops through all the items and providers to find the first image it can.</p><p>Despite all that work, you can&#39;t see the results just yet – we need to do some configuration work first, because Apple&#39;s default action extension is configured for images, not for web page content.</p>`,7);function E(r,N){const a=s("VPCard"),l=s("VidStack"),o=s("FontIcon");return m(),d("div",null,[e("h1",w,[e("a",f,[e("span",null,u(r.$frontmatter.title)+" 관련",1)])]),t(a,i(c({title:"Hacking with iOS – learn to code iPhone and iPad apps with free Swift tutorials",desc:"Learn Swift coding for iOS with these free tutorials – learn Swift, iOS, and Xcode",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/read/README.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),k,y,t(a,i(c({title:"Adding an extension: NSExtensionItem | Hacking with iOS",desc:"Adding an extension: NSExtensionItem",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/read/19/3/adding-an-extension-nsextensionitem",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),t(l,{src:"youtube/Keyo50542nk"}),x,v,b,_,e("p",null,[n("Once your extension has been created, it will appear in the project navigation in its own yellow folder.
