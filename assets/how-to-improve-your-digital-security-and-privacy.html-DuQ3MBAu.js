With great power as an Internet user comes great responsibility – and this is true of using modern passwords.</p><h3 id="use-a-password-manage" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-a-password-manage"><span>Use a Password Manage</span></a></h3><p>Ideally, password managers are the best system to manage your credentials. They offer encryption and security to prevent undesired access, and they&#39;re able to give two critical properties to good passwords.</p><ul><li>First, they give you the ability to auto-generate passwords and login with the password manager if chosen. This helps avoid the cardinal sin of personal security on the web: password reuse across multiple services. If one service gets hacked with your password and you&#39;re reusing it across the web, hackers will try your login/password across the web, potentially turning one hack into multiple.</li><li>Second is that password managers allow you to more easily create longer and more complex passwords.</li></ul>',7),Y={href:"https://github.com/Start9Labs/vaultwarden-startos",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},W=e("code",null,"Start9Labs/vaultwarden-startos",-1),C=e("h3",{id:"use-a-strong-password",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#use-a-strong-password"},[e("span",null,"Use a Strong Password")])],-1),M={href:"https://bitwarden.com/blog/how-long-should-my-password-be/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},A=i('<p>Your password strength can also improve if you add special characters, vary the case from uppercase to lowercase, and add numbers – anything that throws off machines that are going through character combinations by rote, hoping to get lucky.</p><h4 id="examples-of-strong-passwords" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#examples-of-strong-passwords"><span>Examples of strong passwords</span></a></h4><ul><li>32-strings of random characters, ideally including numbers and special characters</li><li>Multiple words strung together with some numbers/special characters to make it easy to work manually</li></ul><h4 id="examples-of-weak-passwords" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#examples-of-weak-passwords"><span>Examples of weak passwords</span></a></h4><ul><li>Commonly used and reused word + number combos, like hello12</li><li>Shorter strings like 342yf – the shorter your combination even if seemingly random, the easier to brute force</li><li>Passwords you use across multiple services no matter their strength (if one of the passwords gets leaked, that will be attempted with all of your services).</li></ul><h3 id="setup-two-factor-authentication" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#setup-two-factor-authentication"><span>Setup Two-Factor Authentication</span></a></h3><p>You should also add two-factor authentication throughout your devices, and ideally the strongest versions of these.

That way you&#39;ll know if somebody has cracked your password (and you&#39;ll want to remove that password from any online services you currently use.).</p><p>Normally, this would be a combination of what&#39;s called HOTP and TOTP two-factor authentication.</p><p>HOTP and TOTP are both different one-time password schemes used by either hardware security keys or 2FA apps like Google Authenticator. You&#39;ll have seen it in action if you use a tool like Aegis or Raivo where you get resetting passcodes that you copy and paste into your browser every 30 seconds.</p><p>The difference between the two is that the HOTP code scheme tends to be used with hardware security keys and increments per use. But this leaves a longer time window where an attacker can breach the code.</p><p>Time-based systems only give you between 30 seconds to 60 seconds to login with the code, but the user is given enough time to retry codes given such a short window.

In the analog world, you can spend cash and rest assured that it is unlikely that your transaction will be traced back to you.</p><p>In the digital world, however, you have the burden of a credit card or debit card linked back to your address and names for every transaction you do.

An example of this is hardware changes that make recent iPhones more resilient, or frequent security updates for the operating system in question, from Linux, Microsoft, to Mac, to iOS and Android.</p><p>The tradeoff with devices, though, tends to be the expense, cost, and maintenance. In theory, having a second device on both laptop and mobile (for travel purposes, for example, to avoid border seizures) is ideal. And you may want to experiment with different operating systems – for example, the privacy-focused GrapheneOS for mobile, and System76 or Pinebooks for Linux-based laptops.</p><p>You might even go further and decide to experiment with home-based servers to run your own services.</p><p>Ultimately, the choice is yours: the cost of experimentation here can be high in terms of time and money spent, but can be well-worth it to maintain control over your own devices and data.</p><div class="hint-container note"><p class="hint-container-title">Takeaway</p><p>Consider the devices you use.
