All structs in Swift come with a default memberwise initializer, which is an initializer that accepts values for all the properties in the struct. However, as soon as you add your *own* initializer to the struct that memberwise initializer goes away, because it‚Äôs possible you‚Äôre doing special work that the default initializer isn‚Äôt aware of.

If you want to keep both the default initializer and your own custom ones, there‚Äôs a simple trick: create your initializers inside an extension rather than as part of the main struct definition.

For example:

\`\`\`swift
struct Person {
    var firstName: String
    var lastName: String
}

extension Person {
    init(name: String) {
        let split = name.components(separatedBy: " ")
        firstName = split.first ?? ""
        lastName = split.last ?? ""
    }
}
\`\`\`

Because my custom initializer is inside an extension, you can create instances of \`Person\` in two ways:

\`\`\`swift
let taylor1 = Person(firstName: "Taylor", lastName: "Swift")
let taylor2 = Person(name: "Taylor Swift")
\`\`\`
