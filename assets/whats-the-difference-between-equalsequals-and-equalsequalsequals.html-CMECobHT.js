You will almost certainly need to use both of them so it‚Äôs worth taking the time to learn them.\n\nFirst, `==` is the equality operator, which tests that two things are equal for whatever definition of ‚Äúequal‚Äù those things use. For example, `5 == 5` is true because there `==` means an integer comparison, and the same is true for other built-in value types such as strings, booleans, and doubles.\n\nThings get more complicated when `==` is used with a struct you built, because by default they cannot be compared ‚Äì you need to make them conform to the `Equatable` protocol.\n\nIn comparison, `===` is the *identity operator*, which checks whether two instances of a class point to the same memory. This is different from equality, because two objects that were created independently using the same values will be considered equal using `==` but not `===` because they are different objects.\n\nThe `===` operator is available only when using classes because structs are designed so they are always uniquely referenced.\n\n"),y])}const x=r(u,[["render",b],["__file","whats-the-difference-between-equalsequals-and-equalsequalsequals.html.vue"]]),v=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/whats-the-difference-between-equalsequals-and-equalsequalsequals.html","title":"What‚Äôs the difference between == and ===?","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"What‚Äôs the difference between == and ===?","description":"Article(s) > What‚Äôs the difference between == and ===?","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-8.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > What‚Äôs the difference between == and ===?"},{"property":"og:description","content":"What‚Äôs the difference between == and ===?"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/whats-the-difference-between-equalsequals-and-equalsequalsequals.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/whats-the-difference-between-equalsequals-and-equalsequalsequals.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"What‚Äôs the difference between == and ===?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > What‚Äôs the difference between == and ===?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-8.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"What‚Äôs the difference between == and ===?\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.44,"words":431},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/whats-the-difference-between-equalsequals-and-equalsequalsequals.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 6Ïõî 1Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{x as comp,v as data};
