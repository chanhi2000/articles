However, sometimes you know information that Swift doesn‚Äôt: you know that the `UIViewController` you have a reference to is in fact your custom `PictureViewController` subclass, and you want to treat it like one.\n\nTypecasting is the process of passing on your extra knowledge to Swift ‚Äì a way of saying ‚Äúthat thing you thought was an X is actually a Y‚Äù. Swift won‚Äôt let you typecast completely unrelated types, which means you can‚Äôt say things like ‚Äúthat thing you thought was a string is actually an integer‚Äù, but is instead mainly used for subclasses.\n\nAs an example, here‚Äôs how we create new view controllers from a storyboard:\n\n```swift\nlet vc = storyboard?.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "Detail") as? DetailViewController\n```\n\nThat `as?` is a typecast - we‚Äôre passing on to Swift the knowledge that the view controller we expect to be created is in fact a `DetailViewController`. If the typecast fails then `vc` will be nil, but if it succeeds then Swift will be able to use it as a `DetailViewController`.\n\n'),y])}const v=r(g,[["render",k],["__file","what-is-typecasting.html.vue"]]),S=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-typecasting.html","title":"What is typecasting?","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"What is typecasting?","description":"Article(s) > What is typecasting?","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-8.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > What is typecasting?"},{"property":"og:description","content":"What is typecasting?"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-typecasting.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-typecasting.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"What is typecasting?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > What is typecasting?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-8.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"What is typecasting?\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.42,"words":425},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-typecasting.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{v as comp,S as data};
