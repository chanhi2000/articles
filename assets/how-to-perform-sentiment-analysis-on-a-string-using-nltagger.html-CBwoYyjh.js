Sentiment analysis uses machine learning to tell us whether a piece of text is considered positive or negative, and it‚Äôs baked right in to iOS with the NaturalLanguage framework.

To perform sentiment analysis takes a handful of lines of code: we create an \`NLTagger\` that creates a sentiment score, assign some text for the tagger to analyze, read the sentiment value, then convert it to a \`Double\` so it can be used.

Let‚Äôs look at the code first, then I‚Äôll break down what it means:

\`\`\`swift
// set up our input
let input = "Hacking with Swift is awesome"

// feed it into the NaturalLanguage framework
let tagger = NLTagger(tagSchemes: [.sentimentScore])
tagger.string = input

// ask for the results
let (sentiment, _) = tagger.tag(at: input.startIndex, unit: .paragraph, scheme: .sentimentScore)

// read the sentiment back and print it
let score = Double(sentiment?.rawValue ?? "0") ?? 0
print(score)
\`\`\`

Now let‚Äôs break that down, starting with the \`tagger.tag()\` call that has three options and two return values.

The options are:

1. Where to start scanning; in the code above we go from the start of our string.
<li>How *much* to scan; in the code above we scan the entire paragraph.
<li>Which specific tag scheme we want to read; we only have one, which is the sentiment score.

What we get *back* is the sentiment score as an \`NLTag\`, plus the range where it was found. We don‚Äôt care about the range, so we‚Äôll ignore it.

The other value, that \`sentiment\` constant, is an \`NLTag?\` with a raw value of a \`String\`. If everything went to plan that string will contain a \`Double\` in the range of -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive), so to read that value we need to do some careful typecasting: 

\`\`\`swift
let score = Double(sentiment?.rawValue ?? "0") ?? 0
print(score)
\`\`\`

That means ‚Äúattempt to read the sentiment‚Äôs raw value, but use the string ‚Äò0‚Äô if that fails, then attempt to convert that to a \`Double\`, but use the value 0 if *that* fails.‚Äù

The end result will be a \`score\` value that is somewhere between -1.0 (very negative) and 1.0 (very positive), or 0.0 if the text is neutral or nothing could be read.

**Note:** In this example I‚Äôve used a short piece of text, but obviously the framework works best with *lots* of text ‚Äì it‚Äôs hard to come to a conclusion given only a few words, and you‚Äôll often get inaccurate readings doing so.
