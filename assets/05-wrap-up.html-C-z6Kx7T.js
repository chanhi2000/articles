If the string already contains the prefix it should return itself; if it doesn‚Äôt contain the prefix, it should return itself with the prefix added. For example: <code>&quot;pet&quot;.withPrefix(&quot;car&quot;)</code> should return ‚Äúcarpet‚Äù.</li><li>Create a <code>String</code> extension that adds an <code>isNumeric</code> property that returns true if the string holds any sort of number. Tip: creating a <code>Double</code> from a <code>String</code> is a failable initializer.</li><li>Create a <code>String</code> extension that adds a <code>lines</code> property that returns an array of all the lines in a string. So, ‚Äúthis\\nis\\na\\ntest‚Äù should return an array with four elements.</li></ol>',4);function R(c,O){const a=n("VPCard"),s=n("router-link"),h=n("VidStack");return w(),u("div",null,[t("h1",m,[t("a",y,[t("span",null,d(c.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),e(a,r(i({title:"Hacking with iOS ‚Äì learn to code iPhone and iPad apps with free Swift tutorials",desc:"Learn Swift coding for iOS with these free tutorials ‚Äì learn Swift, iOS, and Xcode",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/read/README.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),t("nav",k,[t("ul",null,[t("li",null,[e(s,{to:"#review-what-you-learned"},{default:l(()=>[o("Review what you learned")]),_:1})]),t("li",null,[e(s,{to:"#challenge"},{default:l(()=>[o("Challenge")]),_:1})])])]),_,e(a,r(i({title:"Wrap up | Hacking with iOS",desc:"Wrap up",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/read/24/5/wrap-up",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),e(h,{src:"youtube/yzq0jaNsutE"}),b,v,S,x,W,C,e(a,r(i({title:"Review ‚Äì Project 24: Swift Strings ‚Äì Hacking with Swift",desc:"Interactive tests that help gauge your progress learning Swift",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/review/hws/project-24-swift-strings",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),P])}const V=p(f,[["render",R],["__file","05-wrap-up.html.vue"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/read/24/05-wrap-up.html","title":"Wrap up","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Wrap up","description":"Article(s) > Wrap up","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","xcode","appstore","ios"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > Wrap up"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Wrap up"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/read/24/05-wrap-up.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/read/24/05-wrap-up.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Wrap up"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > Wrap up"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Wrap up\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"next":"/hackingwithswift.com/read/25/overview.md","isOriginal":false},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Review what you learned","slug":"review-what-you-learned","link":"#review-what-you-learned","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Challenge","slug":"challenge","link":"#challenge","children":[]}],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.52,"words":457},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/read/24/05-wrap-up.md","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{V as comp,j as data};
