You could even write a trivial app to detect power outages just by plugging in a spare phone then waiting for the charge state to change.\n\nTo get started, first enable the `isBatteryMonitoringEnabled` property of the current device, like this:\n\n```swift\nUIDevice.current.isBatteryMonitoringEnabled = true\n```\n\nYou can now read the current battery level as a value between 0.0 (flat) and 1.0 (fully charged) using this:\n\n```swift\nlet level = UIDevice.current.batteryLevel\n```\n\nIf you want to be notified every time the battery level changes you can register for the `UIDeviceBatteryLevelDidChange` notification (sent up to once a minute), and you can also register for `UIDeviceBatteryStateDidChange` notification to see when the charge state changes. Both of those require `isBatteryMonitoringEnabled` to be enabled.\n\n"),u])}const P=l(p,[["render",y],["__file","how-to-read-the-battery-level-of-an-iphone-or-ipad.html.vue"]]),_=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-read-the-battery-level-of-an-iphone-or-ipad.html","title":"How to read the battery level of an iPhone or iPad","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"How to read the battery level of an iPhone or iPad","description":"Article(s) > How to read the battery level of an iPhone or iPad","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > How to read the battery level of an iPhone or iPad"},{"property":"og:description","content":"How to read the battery level of an iPhone or iPad"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-read-the-battery-level-of-an-iphone-or-ipad.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-read-the-battery-level-of-an-iphone-or-ipad.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"How to read the battery level of an iPhone or iPad"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > How to read the battery level of an iPhone or iPad"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"How to read the battery level of an iPhone or iPad\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.5,"words":451},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-read-the-battery-level-of-an-iphone-or-ipad.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{P as comp,_ as data};
