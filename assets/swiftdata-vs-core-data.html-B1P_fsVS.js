This means quite a few major Core Data features are not yet supported for developers working exclusively in SwiftData, including:</p><ol><li>We don‚Äôt have an equivalent of <code>NSCompoundPredicate</code>, for creating complex, multi-step predicates.</li><li>We don‚Äôt have an equivalent of <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code>, for executing then monitoring queries for changes.</li><li>There is no support for derived attributes, so things like an automatic <code>lastUpdated</code> property aren‚Äôt possible.</li><li>There are no sectioned fetched requests.</li><li>SwiftData does not support abstract classes or child contexts.</li><li>Or pinning to a specific query generation.</li></ol><p>Everyone will have different priorities for those features, but for me missing the first two is <em>hard</em>. Hopefully we‚Äôll see SwiftData continue to improve rapidly over time, until we eventually reach full parity with Core Data.</p><p>You should also keep in mind that SwiftData is extremely new, whereas Core Data has been in constant development for about 20 years. This means you‚Äôre likely to hit edge cases and surprises on a fairly frequent basis, and I think it‚Äôs fair to say that SwiftData has more sharp edges than a porcupine‚Äôs dance party. Do things exactly right and you‚Äôll be happy, but a lot of the time you‚Äôll find yourself staring at a crash wondering which small but apparently critical mistake you made.</p><p>Don‚Äôt despair ‚Äì it will get better! In the meantime, please watch out for the many things marked <strong>Important</strong> or <strong>Tip</strong> in this guide; I‚Äôve gone through the pain for you, so please save yourself the hassle and learn from that pain rather than repeating it.</p>",6);function y(r,v){const e=p("VPCard");return h(),n("div",null,[t("h1",f,[t("a",m,[t("span",null,c(r.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),a(e,o(i({title:"SwiftData by Example",desc:"Back to Home",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftdata/README.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),g,u,a(e,o(i({title:"SwiftData vs Core Data | SwiftData by Example",desc:"SwiftData vs Core Data",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftdata/swiftdata-vs-core-data",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),w])}const k=s(d,[["render",y],["__file","swiftdata-vs-core-data.html.vue"]]),_=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftdata/swiftdata-vs-core-data.html","title":"SwiftData vs Core Data","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"SwiftData vs Core Data","description":"Article(s) > SwiftData vs Core Data","category":["Swift","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swiftdata","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > SwiftData vs Core Data"},{"property":"og:description","content":"SwiftData vs Core Data"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/swiftdata/swiftdata-vs-core-data.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/swiftdata/swiftdata-vs-core-data.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"SwiftData vs Core Data"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > SwiftData vs Core Data"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swiftdata"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2023-09-22T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"SwiftData vs Core Data\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2023-09-22T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2023-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.36,"words":409},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/swiftdata/swiftdata-vs-core-data.md","localizedDate":"2023ÎÖÑ 9Ïõî 22Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{k as comp,_ as data};
