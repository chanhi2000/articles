Each service is important to building a scalable and robust video platform. Here‚Äôs a detailed look at what you will learn:</p><ol><li><strong>Upload Service</strong>: Learn how to handle video uploads effectively, including chunking and managing large file transfers.</li><li><strong>Transcoder Service</strong>: Dive into transcoding with FFmpeg, a powerful tool for converting video formats and optimizing videos for different devices.</li><li><strong>Watch Service</strong>: Implement Adaptive Bitrate Streaming using HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) to ensure smooth playback across various network conditions and devices.</li></ol><h3 id="technologies-covered" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#technologies-covered"><span>Technologies Covered</span></a></h3><p>This course leverages a range of modern technologies to build the YouTube clone:</p><ul><li><strong>Front-end</strong>: JavaScript and React for creating dynamic user interfaces.</li><li><strong>Back-end</strong>: Node.js and Express for building scalable server-side applications.</li><li><strong>Database</strong>: Prisma as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with databases.</li><li><strong>Frameworks</strong>: Next.js for server-side rendering and improved performance.</li><li><strong>Other Tools</strong>: Docker for containerization and Redis for caching to enhance performance and scalability.</li></ul>',12),T={href:"https://youtu.be/FiXOaYnW64w",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function k(r,C){const s=n("VPCard"),a=n("router-link"),l=n("SiteInfo"),c=n("FontIcon"),g=n("VidStack");return y(),p("div",null,[e("h1",b,[e("a",_,[e("span",null,u(r.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),t(s,h(m({title:"React.js > Article(s)",desc:"Article(s)",link:"/programming/js-react/articles/README.md",logo:"/images/ico-wind.svg",background:"rgba(10,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),e("nav",w,[e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(a,{to:"#what-is-high-level-system-design"},{default:i(()=>[o("What is High-Level System Design?")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[t(a,{to:"#course-overview"},{default:i(()=>[o("Course Overview")]),_:1}),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(a,{to:"#technologies-covered"},{default:i(()=>[o("Technologies Covered")]),_:1})])])])])]),L,t(l,{name:"Learn High-Level System Design by Building a YouTube Clone",desc:"High-Level System Design involves creating a blueprint for complex systems, focusing on architecture, component interactions, and scalability.
