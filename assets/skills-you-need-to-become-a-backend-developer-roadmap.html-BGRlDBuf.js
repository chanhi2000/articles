Database Frameworks:</span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>MySQL:</strong> A relational database management system used for storing and retrieving data. It&#39;s widely used for web applications and offers scalability and reliability.</li><li><strong>MongoDB:</strong> A NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents with schema flexibility. It&#39;s suitable for applications with rapidly changing data models or unstructured data.</li></ul><h3 id="_2-web-servers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-web-servers"><span>2. Web Servers:</span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Node.js</strong>: Node.js is a cross-platform (meaning it supports multiple operating systems) JavaScript Runtime Environment that uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. That means it can handle a large number of users at the same time. If you already know JavaScript, Node.js will likely be your best choice for building real-time applications like chat apps, online gaming apps, and collaborative tools.</li><li><strong>Apache HTTP Server 2:</strong> An open-source web server software that delivers web content across the internet. It&#39;s known for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for hosting websites and web applications.<br>If your team is used to using languages like PHP or Python, Apache might be easier for them to work with.</li><li><strong>LiteSpeed</strong>: LiteSpeed is another web server software that helps websites handle lots of visitors without slowing down or crashing. It’s great for businesses that expect a lot of traffic, like during busy times. LiteSpeed also works with many programming languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, and Java.</li></ul><p>Imagine you&#39;re a company with 20 servers that can each handle 500 websites. Together, that’s 10,000 websites. But if you switch to LiteSpeed, you might be able to handle 20,000 websites with the same number of servers. That’s a big improvement!</p><p>When choosing a web server, it depends on what kind of website or app you’re building. If you’re just starting out, try Node.js first. It’s simple because you only need to learn one language (JavaScript) to build both the front part and the back part of your website.</p><h3 id="_3-security-protocols" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-security-protocols"><span>3.
