The easiest way to find the largest of three numbers is to use the \`max()\` function with as many parameters as you want to check, like this:

\`\`\`swift
let first = 10
let second = 15
let third = 18

let largest = max(first, second, third)
\`\`\`

If you wanted, you could also just call \`max()\` twice, like this:

\`\`\`swift
let largest = max(max(first, second), third)
\`\`\`
