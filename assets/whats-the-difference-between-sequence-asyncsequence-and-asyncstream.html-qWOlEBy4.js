Lots of things conform to <code>Sequence</code>, including arrays, strings, ranges, <code>Data</code>, and more. Through protocol extensions <code>Sequence</code> also gives us access to a variety of methods, including <code>contains()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, <code>map()</code>, and others.</p><p>The <code>AsyncSequence</code> protocol is almost identical to <code>Sequence</code>, with the important exception that each element in the sequence is returned asynchronously. I realize that sounds obvious, but it actually has two major impacts on the way they work.</p><p>First, reading a value from the async sequence must use <code>await</code> so the sequence can suspend itself while reading its next value. This might be performing some complex work, for example, or perhaps fetching data from a server.</p><p>Second, more advanced async sequences known as <em>async streams</em> might generate values faster than you can read them, in which case you can either discard the extra values or buffer them to be read later on.</p><p>So, in the first case think of it like your code wanting values faster than the async sequence can make them, whereas in the second case it‚Äôs more like the async sequence generating data faster than than your code can read them.</p><p>Otherwise, <code>Sequence</code> and <code>AsyncSequence</code> have lots in common: the code to create a custom one yourself is almost the same, both can throw errors if you want, both get access to common functionality such as <code>map()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, <code>contains()</code>, and <code>reduce()</code>, and you can also use <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> to exit loops over either of them.</p>",8),g={class:"hint-container details"},q=e("summary",null,"Similar solutions‚Ä¶",-1);function b(a,S){const t=d("VPCard");return l(),r("div",null,[e("h1",m,[e("a",f,[e("span",null,i(a.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),n(t,c(o({title:"Swift Concurrency by Example",desc:"Back to Home",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/concurrency/README.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),p,y,n(t,c(o({title:"What‚Äôs the difference between Sequence, AsyncSequence, and AsyncStream?
