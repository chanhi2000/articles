All nodes in SpriteKit have a \`zPosition\` property that dictates its depth on the screen. If you‚Äôre using Xcode‚Äôs default SpriteKit template then the view you‚Äôre rendering into has its \`ignoresSiblingOrder\` property set to true, which means \`zPosition\` is the only factor that decides whether one node is drawn above or below another.

All Z positions default to 0, but if you use negative values (-1, -2, etc) it forces those nodes to be drawn behind nodes that have higher Z positions (1, 2, etc). These numbers don‚Äôt have any absolute meaning ‚Äì all that matters is that one number is higher or lower than another. That is, setting a Z position to 10,000 doesn‚Äôt make a sprite any larger or more prominent than setting it to 1,000.

Here‚Äôs some example code:

\`\`\`swift
// place the background behind other things
background.zPosition = -1

// place the player in front
player.zPosition = 1

// make the score go above everything
score.zPosition = 10
\`\`\`
