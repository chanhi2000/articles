Before iOS 6.0 was released there were a number of third-party libraries that tried to simplify the sharing of content, but even with those libraries in place it was still far too hard. Fortunately, Apple added \`UIActivityViewController\`, a class that makes sharing to any service as simple as telling it what kind of content you have.

The nice thing about \`UIActivityViewController\` is that it automatically takes advantage of the apps the user has installed. If they have configured Twitter, they can post tweets; if they have configured Facebook, they can post to their timeline; if they have a printer configured, they can print your images; and more. It takes no extra work from you: you just tell iOS what kind of content you want to share, and it does the rest.

Here's how you share an image:

\`\`\`swift
if let image = UIImage(named: "myImage") {
    let vc = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [image], applicationActivities: [])
    present(vc, animated: true)
}
\`\`\`

And here's an example of sharing a text and an image:

\`\`\`swift
let shareText = "Hello, world!"

if let image = UIImage(named: "myImage") {
    let vc = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [shareText, image], applicationActivities: [])
    present(vc, animated: true)
}
\`\`\`

If you want to share a URL to a website, make sure you wrap it up in a \`URL\` first.
