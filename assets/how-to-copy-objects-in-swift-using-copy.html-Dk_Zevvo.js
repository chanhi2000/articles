There are two main complex data types in Swift ‚Äì objects and structs ‚Äì and they do so many things similarly that you'd be forgiven for not being sure exactly where they differ. Well, one of the key areas is down to copying: two variables can point at the same object so that changing one changes them both, whereas if you tried that with structs you'd find that Swift creates a full copy so that changing the copy does not affect the original.

Having lots of objects point at the same data can be useful, but frequently you'll want to modify *copies* so that modifying one object doesn't have an effect on anything else. To make this work you need to do three things:

- Make your class conform to \`NSCopying\`. This isn't strictly required, but it makes your intent clear.
<li>Implement the method \`copy(with:)\`, where the actual copying happens.
<li>Call \`copy()\` on your object.

Here's an example of a \`Person\` class that conforms fully to the \`NSCopying\` protocol:

\`\`\`swift
    class Person: NSObject, NSCopying {
    var firstName: String
    var lastName: String
    var age: Int

    init(firstName: String, lastName: String, age: Int) {
        self.firstName = firstName
        self.lastName = lastName
        self.age = age
    }

    func copy(with zone: NSZone? = nil) -> Any {
        let copy = Person(firstName: firstName, lastName: lastName, age: age)
        return copy
    }
}
\`\`\`

Note that \`copy(with:)\` is implemented by creating a new \`Person\` object using the current person's information.

With that done, you can test out your copying like this:

\`\`\`swift
let paul = Person(firstName: "Paul", lastName: "Hudson", age: 36)
let sophie = paul.copy() as! Person

sophie.firstName = "Sophie"
sophie.age = 6

print("\\(paul.firstName) \\(paul.lastName) is \\(paul.age)")
print("\\(sophie.firstName) \\(sophie.lastName) is \\(sophie.age)")
\`\`\`
