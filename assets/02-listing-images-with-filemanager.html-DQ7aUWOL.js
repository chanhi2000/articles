If you’re considering doing just that, please continue reading first.</p></div><p>That’s a big chunk of code, most of which is new. Let’s walk through what it does line by line:</p><ul><li>The line <code>let fm = FileManager.default</code> declares a constant called <code>fm</code> and assigns it the value returned by <code>FileManager.default</code>. This is a data type that lets us work with the filesystem, and in our case we&#39;ll be using it to look for files.</li><li>The line <code>let path = Bundle.main.resourcePath!</code> declares a constant called <code>path</code> that is set to the resource path of our app&#39;s bundle. Remember, a bundle is a directory containing our compiled program and all our assets. So, this line says, &quot;tell me where I can find all those images I added to my app.&quot;</li><li>The line <code>let items = try! fm.contentsOfDirectory(atPath: path)</code> declares a third constant called <code>items</code> that is set to the contents of the directory at a path. Which path? Well, the one that was returned by the line before. As you can see, Apple&#39;s long method names really does make their code quite self-descriptive! The <code>items</code> constant will be an array of strings containing filenames.</li><li>The line <code>for item in items {</code> starts a loop that will execute once for every item we found in the app bundle. Remember: the line has an opening brace at the end, signaling the start of a new block of code, and there&#39;s a matching closing brace four lines beneath. Everything inside those braces will be executed each time the loop goes around.</li><li>The line <code>if item.hasPrefix(&quot;nssl&quot;) {</code> is the first line inside our loop. By this point, we&#39;ll have the first filename ready to work with, and it&#39;ll be called <code>item</code>. To decide whether it&#39;s one we care about or not, we use the <code>hasPrefix()</code> method: it takes one parameter (the prefix to search for) and returns either true or false. That &quot;if&quot; at the start means this line is a conditional statement: if the item has the prefix &quot;nssl&quot;, then… that&#39;s right, another opening brace to mark another new code block. This time, the code will be executed only if <code>hasPrefix()</code> returned true.</li><li>Finally, the line <code>// this is a picture to load!</code> is a comment – if we reach here, <code>item</code> contains the name of a picture to load from our bundle, so we need to store it somewhere.</li></ul><p>In this instance it’s perfectly fine to use <code>Bundle.main.resourcePath!</code> and <code>try!</code>, because if this code fails it means our app can&#39;t read its own data so something must be seriously wrong. Some Swift developers attempt to write code to handle these catastrophic errors at runtime, but sadly all too often they just mask the actual problem that occurred.</p><p>Right now our code loads the list of files that are inside our app bundle, then loops over them all to find the ones with a name that begins with “nssl”. However, it doesn’t actually <em>do</em> anything with those files, so our next step is to create an array of all the “nssl” pictures so we can refer to them later rather than having to re-read the resources directory again and again.</p><p>The three constants we already created – <code>fm</code>, <code>path</code>, and <code>items</code> – live inside the <code>viewDidLoad()</code> method, and will be destroyed as soon as that method finishes. What we want is a way to attach data to the whole <code>ViewController</code> type so that it will exist for as long as our screen exists. So, this a perfect example of when to use a property – we can give our <code>ViewController</code> class as many of these properties as we want, then read and write them as often as needed while the screen exists.</p><p>To create a property, you need to declare it <em>outside</em> of methods. We’ve been creating constants using <code>let</code> so far, but this array is going to be changed inside our loop so we need to make it variable. We also need to tell Swift exactly what kind of data it will hold – in our case that’s an array of strings, where each item will be the name of an “nssl” picture.</p><p>Add this line of code <em>before</em> <code>viewDidLoad()</code>:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">var</span> pictures <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token class-name">String</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>

It will be empty, because we haven’t actually filled it with anything, but at least it’s there ready for us to fill.</p><p>What we <em>really</em> want is to add to the <code>pictures</code> array all the files we match inside our loop. To do that, we need to replace the existing <code>// this is a picture to load!</code> comment with code to add each picture to the <code>pictures</code> array.</p><p>Helpfully, Swift’s arrays have a built-in method called <code>append</code> that we can use to add any items we want. So, replace the <code>// this is a picture to load!</code> comment with this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line">pictures<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">append</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>item<span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>

Annoyingly, after all that work our app won’t appear to do anything when you press play – you’ll see the same white screen as before. Did it work, or did things just silently fail?</p><p>To find out, add this line of code at the end of <code>viewDidLoad()</code>, just before the closing brace:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token function">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>pictures<span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>

When you run the program now, you should see this text appear at the bottom of your Xcode window: “[&quot;nssl0033.jpg&quot;, &quot;nssl0034.jpg&quot;, &quot;nssl0041.jpg&quot;, &quot;nssl0042.jpg&quot;, &quot;nssl0043.jpg&quot;, &quot;nssl0045.jpg&quot;, &quot;nssl0046.jpg&quot;, &quot;nssl0049.jpg&quot;, &quot;nssl0051.jpg&quot;, &quot;nssl0091.jpg”]”</p><p>Note: iOS likes to print lots of uninteresting debug messages in the Xcode debug console.
