Swift has a dedicated remainder operator in the form of \`%\`, and it‚Äôs used to return the remainder after dividing one number wholly into another. For example, \`14 % 3\` is 2, because you can fit four 3s into 14, and afterwards you have the remainder 2.

The remainder operator is helpful for calculating things like odd and even numbers ‚Äì if you want alternate rows of your table to be a slightly different color, for example, you might write this:

\`\`\`swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if i % 2 == 0 {
        print("Number is even")
    } else {
        print("Number is odd")
    }
}
\`\`\`

You can also use the \`isMultiple(of:)\` method, which does more or less the same thing while being more readable:

\`\`\`swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if i.isMultiple(of: 2) {
        print("Number is even")
    } else {
        print("Number is odd")
    }
}
\`\`\`
