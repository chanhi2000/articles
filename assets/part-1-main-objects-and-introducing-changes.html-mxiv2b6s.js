I will use these terms interchangeably throughout this book, as you should feel comfortable with both of them.</p><p>You can think of adding changes to the index as a way of &quot;confirming&quot; your changes, one by one, before creating a commit (which records all your approved changes at once).</p><p>When you <code>checkout</code> a branch, Git populates the index and the working dir with the contents of the files as they exist in the commit that branch is pointing to.

Since you did not stage <code>2.txt</code>, the index does not include the updated version of <code>2.txt</code>.
