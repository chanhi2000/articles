The <em>next-level</em> level will solve the problem of business analytics.</p><p>Ok. So what <em>is</em> the &quot;problem with business analytics&quot;? It&#39;s the hard work of building sophisticated code that parses large datasets to make them consistently machine readable (also known as &quot;data wrangling&quot;). It then applies complex algorithms to tease out useful insights. The figure below broadly outlines the process.</p><figure><img src="https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/12/gai-8-1.png" alt="A diagram illustrating the data wrangling process" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>A diagram illustrating the data wrangling process</figcaption></figure><p>A lot of the code that fits that description is incredibly complicated, not to mention clever. Inspiring clever data engineers to write that clever code can, of course, cost organizations many, many fortunes. The &quot;problem&quot; then, is the cost.</p><p>So solving that problem could involve leveraging a few hundred dollars worth of large language model (LLM) API charges.

In fact, I&#39;m not even 100% sure what each column of data represents.</p><p>What <em>is</em> clear is that each customer&#39;s age and neighborhood are there. Although the locations have been anonymized as <code>C1</code>, <code>C2</code>, <code>C3</code> and so on, some of the remaining columns clearly contain financial information.</p><p>Based on those assumptions, my ultimate goal is to search for statistically valid relationships between columns. For instance, are there specific demographic features (income, neighborhood, age) that predict a greater likelihood of a customer purchasing additional banking products? For this specific example I&#39;ll see if I can identify the geographic regions within the data whose average household wealth is the highest.</p><p>For normal uses, such vaguely described data would be worthless. But since we&#39;re just looking to demonstrate the process it&#39;ll do just fine. I&#39;ll <em>make up</em> column headers that more or less fit the shape of their data. Here&#39;s how I named them:</p><ul><li>Customer ID</li><li>Customer age</li><li>Geographic location</li><li>Branch visits per year</li><li>Total household assets</li><li>Total household debt</li><li>Total investments with bank</li></ul><p>The column names need to be very descriptive because those will be the only clues I&#39;ll give GPT to help it understand the data.

When that&#39;s done, all the 1,000 data rows will have unique IDs, albeit IDs between 0 and 1 with many decimal places.</p><hr><h2 id="how-to-apply-llamaindex-to-the-problem" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-apply-llamaindex-to-the-problem"><span>How to Apply LlamaIndex to the Problem</span></a></h2>',9),q={href:"https://llamaindex.ai/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},H=e("li",null,"Import the necessary functionality",-1),L={href:"https://llamaindex.ai/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},B=e("li",null,[t("Read the data file that's in the directory called "),e("code",null,"data")],-1),S=e("li",null,"Build the nodes from which we'll populate our index",-1),U=l(`<div class="language-python line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="py" data-title="py"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">import</span> os</span>

It&#39;s always good to test your model just to see if the responses you&#39;re getting seem to reasonably reflect what you already know about the data.</p><p>To answer properly, GPT would need to figure out what each of the column headers means and the relationships <em>between</em> columns. In other words, it would need to know how to calculate net worth for each row (account ID) from the values in the <code>Total household assets</code>, <code>Total household debt</code>, and <code>Total investments with bank</code> columns. It would then need to aggregate all the net worth numbers that it generated by <code>Geographic location</code>, calculate averages for each location and, finally, compare all the averages and rank them.</p><p>The result? I <em>think</em> GPT nailed it. After a minute or two of deep and profound thought (and around $0.25 in API charges), I was shown five location codes (G0, G90, G96, G97, G84, in case you&#39;re curious). This tells me that GPT understands the location column the same way I did and is at least attempting to infer relationships between location and demographic features.</p><p>What did I mean &quot;I think&quot;? Well I never actually checked to confirm that the numbers made sense. For one thing, this isn&#39;t real data anyway and, for all I know, I guessed the contents of each column incorrectly.</p><p>But also because <em>every</em> data analysis needs checking against the real world so, in that sense, GPT-generated analysis is no different. In other words, whenever you&#39;re working with data that&#39;s supposed to represent the real world, you should always find a way to calibrate your data using known values to confirm that the whole thing isn&#39;t a happy fantasy.</p><p>I then asked a second question that reflects a real-world query that would interest any bank:</p><blockquote><p><em>Based on their age, geographic location, number of annual visits to bank branch, and total current investments, who are the ten customers most likely to invest in a new product offering? Show me only the value of the</em> <code>customer ID</code> columns for those ten customers.</p></blockquote><p>Once again GPT spat back a response that at least <em>seemed</em> to make sense. This question was also designed to test GPT on its ability to correlate multiple metrics and submit them to a complex assessment (&quot;...most likely to invest in a new product offering&quot;).</p><p>I&#39;ll rate that as another successful experiment.</p><hr><h2 id="wrapping-up" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wrapping-up"><span>Wrapping Up</span></a></h2><p>GPT – and other LLMs – are capable of independently parsing, analyzing, and deriving insights from large data sets.</p><p>There will be limits to the magic, of course. GPT and its cousins can still hallucinate – especially when your prompts give it too much room to be &quot;creative&quot; or, sometimes, when you&#39;ve been gone too deep into a single prompt thread. And there are also some hard limits to how much data OpenAI will allow you to upload.</p><p>But, overall, you can accomplish more and faster than you can probably imagine right now.</p><p>While all that greatly simplifies the data analytics process, success still depends on understanding the real-world context of your data and coming up with specific and clever prompts. That&#39;ll be your job.</p>`,20),C={href:"https://amzn.to/3yLFT3b",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},j={href:"https://bootstrap-it.com",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function F(r,O){const p=i("VPCard"),n=i("router-link"),c=i("SiteInfo"),o=i("FontIcon");return f(),h("div",null,[e("h1",y,[e("a",b,[e("span",null,u(r.$frontmatter.title)+" 관련",1)])]),a(p,m(g({title:"OpenAI > Article(s)",desc:"Article(s)",link:"/ai/openai/articles/README.md",logo:"/images/ico-wind.svg",background:"rgba(10,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),e("nav",k,[e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[a(n,{to:"#how-to-use-gpt-for-business-analytics"},{default:s(()=>[t("How to Use GPT for Business Analytics")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[a(n,{to:"#how-to-prepare-a-dataset"},{default:s(()=>[t("How to Prepare a Dataset")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[a(n,{to:"#how-to-apply-llamaindex-to-the-problem"},{default:s(()=>[t("How to Apply LlamaIndex to the Problem")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[a(n,{to:"#wrapping-up"},{default:s(()=>[t("Wrapping Up")]),_:1})])])]),v,a(c,{name:"How to Use GPT to Analyze Large Datasets",desc:"Absorbing and then summarizing very large quantities of content in just a few seconds truly is a big deal.
