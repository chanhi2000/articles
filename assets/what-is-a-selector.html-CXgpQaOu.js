They were common in Objective-C, but the earliest versions of Swift didn't include some core selector functionality so their use declined for a while. That functionality (things like `performSelector(inBackground:)`) has since been restored.\n\nIn Swift, selectors are most commonly found when working with the target/action paradigm that you find in classes such as `Timer` and `UIBarButtonItem`. For example, when you create a timer you need to tell it who to notify when the timer fires (the target) and what selector should be called (the action). The same goes for bar button items: when the button is tapped, what selector should be called, and on what object?\n\n"),y])}const v=c(m,[["render",b],["__file","what-is-a-selector.html.vue"]]),S=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-a-selector.html","title":"What is a selector?","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"What is a selector?","description":"Article(s) > What is a selector?","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-7.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > What is a selector?"},{"property":"og:description","content":"What is a selector?"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-a-selector.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-a-selector.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"What is a selector?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > What is a selector?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-7.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"What is a selector?\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.29,"words":387},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-a-selector.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{v as comp,S as data};
