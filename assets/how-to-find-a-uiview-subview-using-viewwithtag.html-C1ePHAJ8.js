The method returns an optional `UIView` because it might not find a view with that tag, so unwrap it carefully.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```swift\nif let foundView = view.viewWithTag(0xDEADBEEF) {\n    foundView.removeFromSuperview()\n}\n```\n\nEasy to remember tags such as `0xDEADBEEF` are quite common amongst coders.\n\nNB: Extensive use of `viewWithTag()` is a sign of poor code structure. It's good for the occasional shortcut, but really shouldn't be relied on for serious development.\n\nYou see, if you use `viewWithTag()` to find some specific nested view then you‚Äôre effectively saying ‚Äúthere's a view that I have given a magic number to, and it's definitely a `UIImageView` (for example), so please find it and use it.‚Äù This means you're bypassing all the safety of the Swift compiler: that number might change or be removed, or the view in question might change type or be removed ‚Äì and neither of those would cause problems or get caught.\n\nIf you use `viewWithTag()` rarely then it's fine, but if you find yourself doing it a lot then really you should be thinking about an alternative ‚Äì making a custom subclass for your table view cell, for example.\n\n"),v])}const _=r(u,[["render",b],["__file","how-to-find-a-uiview-subview-using-viewwithtag.html.vue"]]),x=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-find-a-uiview-subview-using-viewwithtag.html","title":"How to find a UIView subview using viewWithTag()","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"How to find a UIView subview using viewWithTag()","description":"Article(s) > How to find a UIView subview using viewWithTag()","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-2.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > How to find a UIView subview using viewWithTag()"},{"property":"og:description","content":"How to find a UIView subview using viewWithTag()"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-find-a-uiview-subview-using-viewwithtag.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-find-a-uiview-subview-using-viewwithtag.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"How to find a UIView subview using viewWithTag()"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > How to find a UIView subview using viewWithTag()"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-2.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-09-26T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"How to find a UIView subview using viewWithTag()\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-09-26T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.75,"words":526},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-find-a-uiview-subview-using-viewwithtag.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 9Ïõî 26Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{_ as comp,x as data};
