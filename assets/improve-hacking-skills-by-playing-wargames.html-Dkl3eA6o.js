They simulate attacking and defending computer systems. These games often mimic real-life scenarios. They help you improve your skills without real-world risks.</p><p>Wargames can take different forms. Capture the Flag (CTF) is a common type. Players solve challenges to find hidden ‚Äúflags‚Äù in the system. In attack-defense games, teams protect their systems while trying to compromise the opponent‚Äôs. In incident response wargames, defenders react to a simulated cyberattack and work to recover.</p><p>Wargames give you hands-on experience in cybersecurity. They teach you how to solve problems, think critically, and handle pressure while working in teams.
