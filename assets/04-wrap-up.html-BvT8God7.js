Make sure you set a Boolean to say the alert has been shown, so it doesnâ€™t keep appearing.</li><li>Go through two or three other iBeacons in the Detect Beacon app and add their UUIDs to your app, then register all of them with iOS. Now add a second label to the app that shows new text depending on which beacon was located.</li><li>Add a circle to your view, then use animation to scale it up and down depending on the distance from the beacon â€“ try 0.001 for unknown, 0.25 for far, 0.5 for near, and 1.0 for immediate. You can make the circle by adding an image, or by creating a view thatâ€™s 256 wide by 256 high then setting its <code>layer.cornerRadius</code> to 128 so that itâ€™s round.</li></ol>',4);function B(c,P){const a=r("VPCard"),s=r("router-link"),h=r("VidStack");return g(),d("div",null,[e("h1",f,[e("a",y,[e("span",null,u(c.$frontmatter.title)+" ê´€ë ¨",1)])]),t(a,n(i({title:"Hacking with iOS â€“ learn to code iPhone and iPad apps with free Swift tutorials",desc:"Learn Swift coding for iOS with these free tutorials â€“ learn Swift, iOS, and Xcode",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/read/README.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),e("nav",k,[e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(s,{to:"#review-what-you-learned"},{default:l(()=>[o("Review what you learned")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[t(s,{to:"#challenge"},{default:l(()=>[o("Challenge")]),_:1})])])]),b,t(a,n(i({title:"Wrap up | Hacking with iOS",desc:"Wrap up",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/read/22/4/wrap-up",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),t(h,{src:"youtube/RJXC2wv8vQQ"}),_,v,S,W,x,t(a,n(i({title:"Review â€“ Project 22: Detect-a-Beacon â€“ Hacking with Swift",desc:"Interactive tests that help gauge your progress learning Swift",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/review/hws/project-22-detect-a-beacon",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),R])}const O=p(m,[["render",B],["__file","04-wrap-up.html.vue"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/read/22/04-wrap-up.html","title":"Wrap up","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Wrap up","description":"Article(s) > Wrap up","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","xcode","appstore","ios"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > Wrap up"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Wrap up"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/read/22/04-wrap-up.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/read/22/04-wrap-up.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ðŸ“šBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Wrap up"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > Wrap up"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Wrap up\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"next":"/hackingwithswift.com/read/23/overview.md","isOriginal":false},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Review what you learned","slug":"review-what-you-learned","link":"#review-what-you-learned","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Challenge","slug":"challenge","link":"#challenge","children":[]}],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.64,"words":491},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/read/22/04-wrap-up.md","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{O as comp,V as data};
