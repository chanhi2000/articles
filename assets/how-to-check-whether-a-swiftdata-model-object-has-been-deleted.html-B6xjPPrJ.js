The actual deletion won&#39;t take place until the next save is triggered; in the meantime the object will still be around, just stored in the <code>deletedModelsArray</code> of your context. Objects marked for deletion but not yet <em>actually</em> deleted will still appear in results from <code>@Query</code>.</p><p>Second, if any part of your app retains a copy of a deleted model, <code>isDeleted</code> will appear <code>true</code> at first, but it may then flip back to <code>false</code> ‚Äì even though the object itself has been deleted.</p><p>Third, if you don&#39;t have autosave enabled <em>and</em> any part of your app retains a copy of the deleted model, attempting to change any properties is likely to result in a crash because the underlying data has been destroyed.</p><p>Fourth, as a result of all these there&#39;s very little point trying to read the <code>isDeleted</code> in the <code>disabled()</code> SwiftUI view modifier ‚Äì you might think it&#39;s helpful to disable a form if an object no longer exists, but in practice it&#39;s just a bit too quirky to rely upon.</p>",6);function g(c,k){const t=h("VPCard");return s(),l("div",null,[e("h1",m,[e("a",w,[e("span",null,n(c.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),o(t,a(i({title:"SwiftData by Example",desc:"Back to Home",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftdata/README.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),f,b,o(t,a(i({title:"How to check whether a SwiftData model object has been deleted | SwiftData by Example",desc:"How to check whether a SwiftData model object has been deleted",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftdata/how-to-check-whether-a-swiftdata-model-object-has-been-deleted",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),u])}const _=r(p,[["render",g],["__file","how-to-check-whether-a-swiftdata-model-object-has-been-deleted.html.vue"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/swiftdata/how-to-check-whether-a-swiftdata-model-object-has-been-deleted.html","title":"How to check whether a SwiftData model object has been deleted","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"How to check whether a SwiftData model object has been deleted","description":"Article(s) > How to check whether a SwiftData model object has been deleted","category":["Swift","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swiftdata","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > How to check whether a SwiftData model object has been deleted"},{"property":"og:description","content":"How to check whether a SwiftData model object has been deleted"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/swiftdata/how-to-check-whether-a-swiftdata-model-object-has-been-deleted.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/swiftdata/how-to-check-whether-a-swiftdata-model-object-has-been-deleted.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"How to check whether a SwiftData model object has been deleted"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > How to check whether a SwiftData model object has been deleted"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swiftdata"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2023-09-30T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"How to check whether a SwiftData model object has been deleted\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2023-09-30T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2023-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.3,"words":391},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/swiftdata/how-to-check-whether-a-swiftdata-model-object-has-been-deleted.md","localizedDate":"2023ÎÖÑ 9Ïõî 30Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{_ as comp,D as data};
