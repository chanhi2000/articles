You can see if this is working by rotating to landscape, because the labels won‚Äôt go under the safe area.</li><li>Try making the height of your labels equal to 1/5th of the main view, minus 10 for the spacing. This is a hard one, but I‚Äôve included hints below!</li></ol><hr><h2 id="hints" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hints"><span>Hints</span></a></h2><p>It is <em>vital</em> to your learning that you try the challenges above yourself, and not just for a handful of minutes before you give up.</p><p>Every time you try something wrong, you learn that it‚Äôs wrong and you‚Äôll remember that it‚Äôs wrong. By the time you find the <em>correct</em> solution, you‚Äôll remember it much more thoroughly, while also remembering a lot of the wrong turns you took.</p><p>This is what I mean by ‚Äúthere is no learning without struggle‚Äù: if something comes easily to you, it can go just as easily. But when you have to really mentally fight for something, it will stick much longer.</p><p>But if you‚Äôve already worked hard at the challenges above and are still struggling to implement them, I‚Äôm going to write some hints below that should guide you to the correct answer.</p><p><strong>If you ignore me and read these hints without having spent at least 30 minutes trying the challenges above, the only person you‚Äôre cheating is yourself.</strong></p><p>Still here? OK. If you‚Äôre stuck on the last challenge, try looking at Xcode‚Äôs code completion options for the <code>constraint()</code> method. We‚Äôre using the <code>equalToConstant</code> option right now, but there are others ‚Äì the <code>equalTo</code> option lets you specify another height anchor as its first parameter, along with a multiplier and a constant.</p><p>When you use both a multiplier and a constant, the multiplier gets factored in first then the constant.
