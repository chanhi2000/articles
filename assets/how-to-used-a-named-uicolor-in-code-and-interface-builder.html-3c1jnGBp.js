Since Xcode 9.0 we‚Äôve been able to create named colors directly inside asset catalogs, which means it‚Äôs possible to select a precise color once then use it uniformly across all code and storyboards.

To try this out, open your asset catalog, click the + button, then choose New Color Set from the menu that appears. Select the new color that got created ‚Äì it will be a large white square ‚Äì then press Alt+<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+4 to activate the attributes inspector so that you can customize it.

Named colors are comprised of two rather obvious parts: a name (e.g. ‚ÄúPayPal blue‚Äù) and a color, which you can specify as ranges from 0-1, ranges from 0-255, or hexadecimal.

Once a named color is in place you can use it code like this:

\`\`\`swift
myView.backgroundColor = UIColor(named: "Chartreuse")
\`\`\`

You can also use it inside storyboards by selecting it from the color dropdown menu ‚Äì all your named colors will automatically be shown in their own section of the menu.
