Like regular functions, closures can accept values and return values of your choosing: just write them out at the start of your closure, followed by the word \`in\`.

For example, we could write a \`greeting\` closure that accepts the name of a person to greet and returns a string using that name:

\`\`\`swift
let greeting = { (name: String) -> String in
    return "Hello, \\(name)!"
}
\`\`\`

You can now call that just like any other function, passing in someone‚Äôs name as its only parameter:

\`\`\`swift
let message = greeting("Taylor")
\`\`\`
