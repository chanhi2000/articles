Here's a basic example:\n\n```swift\nlet layer = CAGradientLayer()\nlayer.frame = CGRect(x: 64, y: 64, width: 160, height: 160)\nlayer.colors = [UIColor.red.cgColor, UIColor.black.cgColor]\nview.layer.addSublayer(layer)\n```\n\nNote that you need to fill in an array of `colors` that will be used to draw the gradient. You can provide more than one if you want to, at which point you will also need to fill in the `locations` array to tell `CAGradientLayer` where each color starts and stops. Note that you need to specify your colors as `CGColor` and not `UIColor`.\n\nIf you want to make your gradient work in a different direction, you should set the `startPoint` and `endPoint` properties. These are both `CGPoints` where the X and Y values are between 0 and 1, where 0 is one edge and 1 is the opposite edge. The default start point is X 0.5, Y 0.0 and the default end point is X 0.5, Y 1.0, which means both points are in the center of the layer, but it starts at the top and ends at the bottom.\n\nYou might be interested to know that `CAGradientLayer` happily works with translucent colors, meaning that you can make a gradient that fades out.\n\n"),f])}const A=s(g,[["render",C],["__file","how-to-draw-color-gradients-using-cagradientlayer.html.vue"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/calayer/how-to-draw-color-gradients-using-cagradientlayer.html","title":"How to draw color gradients using CAGradientLayer","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"How to draw color gradients using CAGradientLayer","description":"Article(s) > How to draw color gradients using CAGradientLayer","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-3.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > How to draw color gradients using CAGradientLayer"},{"property":"og:description","content":"How to draw color gradients using CAGradientLayer"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/calayer/how-to-draw-color-gradients-using-cagradientlayer.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/calayer/how-to-draw-color-gradients-using-cagradientlayer.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"How to draw color gradients using CAGradientLayer"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > How to draw color gradients using CAGradientLayer"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-3.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"How to draw color gradients using CAGradientLayer\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.68,"words":505},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/calayer/how-to-draw-color-gradients-using-cagradientlayer.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{A as comp,G as data};
