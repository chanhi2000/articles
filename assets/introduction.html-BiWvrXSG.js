But how many truly understand Git? Do <em>you</em> feel like you know what&#39;s going on under the hood as you use Git to perform various tasks?</p><p>For example, what happens when you use <code>git commit</code>? What is stored between commits? Is it just a diff between the current and previous commit? If so, how is the diff encoded? Or is an entire snapshot of the repository stored each time?</p><p>Most people who use Git don&#39;t know the answers to the questions posed above. But does it really matter? Do you really have to know all of those things?</p><p>I&#39;d argue that it does matter. As professionals, we should strive to understand the tools we use, especially if we use them all the time, like Git.</p><p>Even more acutely, I&#39;ve found that understanding how Git actually works is <strong>useful</strong> in many scenarios — whether resolving merge conflicts, looking to conduct an interesting rebase, or even just when something goes slightly wrong.</p><p>So many times have I received questions about Git from experienced, highly skilled software engineers. I have seen wonderful developers react in fear when something happened in their commit history, and they just didn&#39;t know what to do. It doesn&#39;t have to be this way.</p><p>By reading this book, you will gain a new perspective of Git. You will feel <strong>confident</strong> when working with Git, and you will <strong>understand</strong> Git&#39;s underlying mechanisms, at least those that are useful to understand. You will <em>Git</em> it. You will be <em>Gitting things done</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="who-is-this-book-for" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#who-is-this-book-for"><span>Who Is This Book For?</span></a></h2><p>Any software developer who wants to deepen their knowledge about Git.</p><p>If you are experienced with Git - I am sure you will be able to deepen your knowledge. Even if you are new to Git - I will start with an overview of the mechanisms of Git, and the terms used throughout this book.</p><p>This book is for you. I wrote it so you can learn more about Git, and also come to appreciate, or even love Git.</p><p>You will also notice that I use a casual style throughout the book. I believe that learning Git should be insightful and fun. Learning new things is always hard, and I felt like writing in a less casual style wouldn&#39;t really make a good service. And as I already mentioned - this book is for you.</p><hr><h2 id="who-am-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#who-am-i"><span>Who Am I?</span></a></h2><p>This book is about you, and your journey with Git.

When sitting down to write it, I had three principles in mind.</p><ol><li><strong>Practical</strong> - in this book, you will learn how to accomplish things in Git. How to introduce changes, how to undo them, and how to fix things when they go wrong. You will understand how Git works not just for the sake of understanding, but with a practical mindset. I sometimes refer to this as the &quot;practicality principle&quot; - which guides me in deciding whether to include certain topics, and to what extent.</li><li><strong>In depth</strong> - you will dive deep into Git&#39;s way of operating, to understand its mechanisms. You will build your understanding gradually, and always link your knowledge to real scenarios you might face in your work. In order to achieve an in-depth understanding, I almost always prefer the command line over graphical interfaces, so you can really see what commands are running.</li><li><strong>Visual</strong> - as I strive to provide you with intuition, the chapters will be accompanied by visual aids.</li></ol><hr><h2 id="why-is-this-book-publicly-available" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-is-this-book-publicly-available"><span>Why Is This Book Publicly Available?</span></a></h2><p>I think everyone should have access to high quality content about Git, and I&#39;d like this book to get to as many people as possible.</p>',10),B={href:"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CQXTJ5V5",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},A={href:"https://buymeacoffee.com/omerr/e/197232",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},x={href:"https://buymeacoffee.com/omerr",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},P=e("hr",null,null,-1),C=e("h2",{id:"accompanying-videos",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#accompanying-videos"},[e("span",null,"Accompanying Videos")])],-1),D={href:"https://youtube.com/@BriefVid",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},F=e("code",null,"@BriefVid",-1),V=r('<hr><h2 id="get-your-hands-dirty" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#get-your-hands-dirty"><span>Get Your Hands Dirty</span></a></h2><p>Throughout this book, I will mostly use the second person singular - and directly write to <em>you</em>.
