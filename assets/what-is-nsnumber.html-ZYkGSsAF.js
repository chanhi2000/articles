It was important in Objective-C because its primitive number types ‚Äì integers, doubles, etc ‚Äì could not be used in most of Apple‚Äôs APIs without wrapping them in an object such as `NSNumber`, but mostly Swift does a good job of automatically converting its numbers to `NSNumber` when you need it.\n\nThat being said, there are a few times when Swift won‚Äôt help you out, and you need to convert to `NSNumber` by hand. For example, this code is designed to convert numerical numbers like 50 into textual numbers like ‚Äúfifty‚Äù, but it won‚Äôt compile:\n\n```swift\nlet number = 50\nlet formatter = NumberFormatter()\nformatter.numberStyle = .spellOut\n\n// this line won\'t work\n// let string1 = formatter.string(from: number) ?? ""\n```\n\nThe problem is that the `string(from:)` method expects an `NSNumber` and Swift isn‚Äôt able to automatically bridge the integer we created in `number`. The fix here is nice and easy ‚Äì just add `as NSNumber` to help Swift bridge the two worlds:\n\n```swift\nlet string2 = formatter.string(from: number as NSNumber) ?? ""\n```\n\n'),w])}const _=s(u,[["render",y],["__file","what-is-nsnumber.html.vue"]]),x=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-nsnumber.html","title":"What is NSNumber?","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"What is NSNumber?","description":"Article(s) > What is NSNumber?","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-8.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > What is NSNumber?"},{"property":"og:description","content":"What is NSNumber?"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-nsnumber.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-nsnumber.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"What is NSNumber?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > What is NSNumber?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-8.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"What is NSNumber?\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.34,"words":402},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/language/what-is-nsnumber.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{_ as comp,x as data};
