Although the types themselves aren‚Äôt <em>complex</em>, they unlock a lot of power and flexibility, and sit at the core of how we use concurrency with Swift.</p><p>Which you choose ‚Äì <code>Task</code> or <code>TaskGroup</code> ‚Äì depends on the goal of your work: if you want one or two independent pieces of work to start, then <code>Task</code> is the right choice. If you want to split up one job into several concurrent operations then <code>TaskGroup</code> is a better fit. Task groups work best when their individual operations return exactly the same kind of data, but with a little extra effort you can coerce them into supporting heterogenous data types.</p><p>Although you might not realize it, you‚Äôre using tasks every time you write any async code in Swift. You see, all async functions run as part of a task whether or not we explicitly ask for it to happen. Even using <code>async let</code> is <em>syntactic sugar</em> for creating a task then waiting for its result ‚Äì special syntax that makes a particular piece of code easier to write. This is why if you use multiple sequential <code>async let</code> calls they will all start executing immediately while the rest of your code continues.</p><p>Both <code>Task</code> and <code>TaskGroup</code> can be created with one of four priority levels: <code>high</code> is the most important, then <code>medium</code>, <code>low</code>, and finally <code>background</code> at the bottom. Task priorities allow the system to adjust the order in which it executes work, meaning that important work can happen before unimportant work.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p><p>If you‚Äôve been doing iOS programming for a while, you may prefer to use the more familiar quality of service priorities from <code>DispatchQueue</code>, which are <code>userInitiated</code> and <code>utility</code> in place of <code>high</code> and <code>low</code> respectively. There is no equivalent to the old <code>userInteractive</code> priority, which is now exclusively reserved for the user interface.</p></div>',7),f={class:"hint-container details"},y=t("summary",null,"Similar solutions‚Ä¶",-1);function b(n,v){const e=h("VPCard");return d(),c("div",null,[t("h1",p,[t("a",k,[t("span",null,r(n.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),a(e,o(s({title:"Swift Concurrency by Example",desc:"Back to Home",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/concurrency/README.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),g,w,a(e,o(s({title:"What are tasks and task groups?
