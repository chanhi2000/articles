You created a blob, a tree, and a commit object pointing to that tree.</p><p>In <strong>Part 2</strong> you learned about branching and integrating changes in Git.</p><p>You learned what a <strong>diff</strong> is, and the difference between a diff and a <strong>patch</strong>. You also learned how the output of <code>git diff</code> is constructed.</p><p>Then, you got an extensive overview of merging with Git, specifically understanding the three-way merge algorithm. You understood when <strong>merging conflicts</strong> occur, when Git can resolve them automatically, and how to resolve them manually when needed.</p><p>You saw that <code>git rebase</code> is powerful - but also that it is quite simple once you understand what it does. You understood the differences between merging and rebasing, and when you should use each.</p><p>In <strong>Part 3</strong> you learned how to <strong>undo changes</strong> in Git - especially when things go wrong. You learned how to use a bunch of tools, like <code>git reset</code>, <code>git commit --amend</code>, <code>git revert</code>, <code>git reflog</code> (and <code>git log -g</code>).</p><p>The most important tool, even more important than the tools I just listed, is to whiteboard the current situation vs the desired one. Trust me on this, it will make every situation seem less daunting and the solution more clear.</p><p>In <strong>Part 4</strong> you acquired additional powerful tools, like different switches of <code>git log</code>, <code>git bisect</code>, <code>git cherry-pick</code>, <code>git revert</code> and <code>git add -p</code>.</p><p>Wow, you should be proud of yourself!</p><hr><h2 id="a-message-from-me-to-you" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-message-from-me-to-you"><span>A Message From Me to You</span></a></h2><p>Indeed, this was fun, but all things must pass. You finished reading this book, but this doesn&#39;t mean your learning journey ends here.</p><p>What you have acquired, more than any specific tool, is intuition and understanding of how Git operates, and how to think about various operations in Git. Keep researching, reading, and using Git. I am sure you will be able to teach me something new, and by all means - please do.</p><p>If you liked this book, please share it with more people.</p><p>If you want to read more of my Git articles and handbooks, here they are:</p>',20),I=e("hr",null,null,-1),T=e("h2",{id:"acknowledgements",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#acknowledgements"},[e("span",null,"Acknowledgements")])],-1),P=e("p",null,"Many people helped make this book the best it can be.
