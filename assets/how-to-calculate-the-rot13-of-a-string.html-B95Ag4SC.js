ROT13 is a simple algorithm that shifts letters in a string forward 13 places. It‚Äôs obviously not suitable for any serious encryption, but it‚Äôs very useful for hiding text so its meaning is not obvious ‚Äì posting spoilers on a forum, for example, is best done using ROT13 to avoid someone getting annoyed.

It‚Äôs not hard to write a \`rot13()\` function, but it *is* a little harder to wrap it up neatly so you avoid global variables while still making it easy to use. Because you can‚Äôt add stored variables to an extension on \`String\`, the cleanest thing to do is create a new \`ROT13\` type that can store the transformation from regular letters to ROT13, then run the calculation.

In code, it looks like this:

\`\`\`swift
struct ROT13 {
    // create a dictionary that will store our character mapping
    private static var key = [Character: Character]()

    // create arrays of all uppercase and lowercase letters
    private static let uppercase = Array("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ")
    private static let lowercase = Array("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")

    static func string(_ string: String) -> String {
        // if this is the first time the method is being called, calculate the ROT13 key dictionary
        if ROT13.key.isEmpty {
            for i in 0 ..< 26 {
                ROT13.key[ROT13.uppercase[i]] = ROT13.uppercase[(i + 13) % 26]
                ROT13.key[ROT13.lowercase[i]] = ROT13.lowercase[(i + 13) % 26]
            }
        }

        // now return the transformed string
        let transformed = string.map { ROT13.key[$0] ?? $0 }
        return String(transformed)
    }
}
\`\`\`

I‚Äôve used private properties there because there‚Äôs no reason these implementation details should leak out, and it‚Äôs all static because there‚Äôs no need to create new \`ROT13\` instances every time we need to run the conversion.

With that in place we can write an extension on \`String\` to calculate the ROT13 using our struct:

\`\`\`swift
extension String {
    func rot13() -> String {
        return ROT13.string(self)
    }
}
\`\`\`

That extension can now be called on a regular string, so users don‚Äôt need to care about how we implemented ROT13:

\`\`\`swift
print("Hello, world!".rot13())
\`\`\`
