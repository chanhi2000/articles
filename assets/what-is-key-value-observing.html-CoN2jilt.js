Key-value observing is the ability for Swift to attach code to variables, so that whenever the variable is changed the code runs. It‚Äôs similar to property observers (\`willSet\` and \`didSet\` ), except KVO is for adding observers *outside* of the type definition.

KVO isn‚Äôt terribly nice in pure Swift code, because it relies on the Objective-C runtime ‚Äì you need to use \`@objc\` classes that inherit from \`NSObject\`, then mark each of your properties with \`@objc dynamic\`.

For example, we could create a \`Person\` class like this:

\`\`\`swift
@objc class Person: NSObject {
    @objc dynamic var name = "Taylor Swift"
}

let taylor = Person()
\`\`\`

You could then observe that user‚Äôs name changing like this:

\`\`\`swift
taylor.observe(\\Person.name, options: .new) { person, change in
    print("I'm now called \\(person.name)")
}
\`\`\`

That asks Swift to watch for new values coming in, then prints the person‚Äôs name as soon as the new value is set.

To try it out, just change the person‚Äôs name to something else:

\`\`\`swift
taylor.name = "Justin Bieber"
\`\`\`

That will print ‚ÄúI‚Äôm now called Justin Bieber.‚Äù

Although KVO is unpleasant in pure Swift code, it‚Äôs better when working with Apple‚Äôs own APIs ‚Äì they are all automatically both \`@objc\` and \`dynamic\` because they are written in Objective-C. 

However, one warning: even though large parts of UIKit might work with KVO, this is a coincidence rather than a promise ‚Äì Apple make no guarantees about UIKit remaining KVO-compatible in the future.
