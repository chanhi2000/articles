When used with a lowercase S, `self` refers to the value inside that type, e.g. ‚Äúhello‚Äù or 556.\n\nAs an example, consider this extension on `BinaryInteger`:\n\n```swift\nextension BinaryInteger {\n    func squared() -> Self {\n        return self * self\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRemember, `Self` with a capital S refers to whatever type is conforming to the protocol. In the example above, `Int` conforms to `BinaryInteger`, so when called on `Int` the method returns an `Int`.\n\nOn the other hand, `self` with a *lowercase* S refers to whatever value the type holds.
