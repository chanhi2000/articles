You can make a method call run after a number of seconds have elapsed using \`perform(_:withObject:afterDelay:)\`, like this:

\`\`\`swift
perform(#selector(yourMethodHere), with: nil, afterDelay: 1)
\`\`\`

However, what if you change your mind, and decide you don't want \`yourMethodHere()\` to be called? As long as you act before that timer expires, you have two options: cancel that specific delayed call, or cancel all delayed calls.

To cancel that specific method call, you need to use the method \`cancelPreviousPerformRequests(withTarget:)\` on \`NSObject\`. Provide it with a target (where the method was going to be called), as well as the same selector and object you used when calling \`perform()\`, and it will cancel that delayed call.

For example:

\`\`\`swift
// set up a delayed call‚Ä¶
perform(#selector(yourMethodHere), with: nil, afterDelay: 1)

// ‚Ä¶then immediately cancel it
NSObject.cancelPreviousPerformRequests(withTarget: self, selector: #selector(yourMethodHere), object: nil)
\`\`\`

Being able to filter the cancellation by both selector and object means you can be very specific: "cancel the printing call for this filename."

If you've made a number of delayed calls and want to cancel them all ‚Äì very helpful if you're about to leave a view controller, for example, and want to abandon any queued work ‚Äì you can use this method call instead:

\`\`\`swift
NSObject.cancelPreviousPerformRequests(withTarget: self)
\`\`\`

That will cancel every call that was queued up on \`self\`, regardless of which selectors and objects were used.

If you're making delayed calls on a specific object, just use that object in place of \`self\`. For example:

\`\`\`swift
myObj.perform(#selector(yourMethodHere), with: nil, afterDelay: 1)
NSObject.cancelPreviousPerformRequests(withTarget: myObj, selector: #selector(yourMethodHere), object: nil)
\`\`\`
