The default value is `.alpha`, which means the sprite should be drawn so that its alpha transparency is respected ‚Äì any parts that are translucent get blended with the existing background color at that point, and any fully transparent parts are not drawn at all.\n\nAlpha drawing is obviously a sensible default, because it allows us to render sprites with irregular shapes and holes. However, if you know for a fact that your sprite is completely rectangular and has no holes then using `.alpha` is wasteful ‚Äì SpriteKit is forced to do alpha blending even though it isn‚Äôt required. This is particularly common with background images: if they are designed to fill the full screen, there‚Äôs no need to make them drawing using `.alpha`. \n\nTo fix this ‚Äì and make such drawing significantly faster ‚Äì change the blend mode of opaque sprites to be `.replace`, which ignores any alpha in the texture:\n\n```swift\nbackground.blendMode = .replace\n```\n\n"),b])}const x=i(h,[["render",S],["__file","how-to-made-an-skspritenode-render-faster-using-blendmode.html.vue"]]),K=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/games/how-to-made-an-skspritenode-render-faster-using-blendmode.html","title":"How to made an SKSpriteNode render faster using blendMode","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"How to made an SKSpriteNode render faster using blendMode","description":"Article(s) > How to made an SKSpriteNode render faster using blendMode","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-7.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > How to made an SKSpriteNode render faster using blendMode"},{"property":"og:description","content":"How to made an SKSpriteNode render faster using blendMode"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/games/how-to-made-an-skspritenode-render-faster-using-blendmode.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/games/how-to-made-an-skspritenode-render-faster-using-blendmode.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"How to made an SKSpriteNode render faster using blendMode"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > How to made an SKSpriteNode render faster using blendMode"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-7.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"How to made an SKSpriteNode render faster using blendMode\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.49,"words":447},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/games/how-to-made-an-skspritenode-render-faster-using-blendmode.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{x as comp,K as data};
