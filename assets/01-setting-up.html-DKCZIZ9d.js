These options are listed under the Product &gt; Destination menu, and you should see iPad Air, iPhone 8, and so on.</p><p>There&#39;s also a shortcut for this menu: at the top-left of Xcode&#39;s window is the play and stop button, but to the right of that it should say Project1 then a device name.
