All views naturally fill the space assigned to them, but using \`CAGradientLayer\` as a mask view you can force a view to fade out at its edges.

To try it out, first create a test view with some obvious content like a background color:

\`\`\`swift
let maskedView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 256, height: 256))
maskedView.backgroundColor = .blue
\`\`\`

The next step is to create a \`CAGradientLayer\` at the same size as the view you want to mask:

\`\`\`swift
let gradientMaskLayer = CAGradientLayer()
gradientMaskLayer.frame = maskedView.bounds
\`\`\`

Now for the important part: to make the gradient work you need to use a clear color where nothing should be shown (where your view should be invisible) and white where the view should shine through fully.

By default \`GAGradientLayer\` spaces out its colors so they appear at equal distances, but we‚Äôre going to tell it to put the first color at 0, the second color at 0.1 (10% of the way in), the third color at 0.9 (90% of the way in), then the last color at 1 (the end). This 80% of our view is shown with full opacity:

\`\`\`swift
gradientMaskLayer.colors = [UIColor.clear.cgColor, UIColor.white.cgColor, UIColor.white.cgColor, UIColor.clear.cgColor]
gradientMaskLayer.locations = [0, 0.1, 0.9, 1]
\`\`\`

Finally, you just need to add that mask to your view, then add the whole thing to a parent view so it can be shown:

\`\`\`swift
maskedView.layer.mask = gradientMaskLayer
view.addSubview(maskedView)
\`\`\`
