At the very least, you should explain to your friend how the cards work: there are eight cards with different shapes on, but only one has a green star. Let your friend try finding the card by hand, to prove the set up is real. Lucky people will guess the star correctly; very lucky people will guess twice in a row; but it&#39;s almost impossible that someone will get the answer right three times in a row - that&#39;s where you come in!</p><p>The easiest way to get started with the trick is by putting your finger down over one card, then dragging it slowly over the other cards. Note: don&#39;t tap the cards, because that will turn one of them over. Instead, slide your finger over them as if you&#39;re feeling for â€“ <em>ahem</em> â€“ psychic vibrations.</p><p>When you&#39;ve done the trick correctly once or twice, your doubting friend will almost certainly think that there&#39;s some secret signal on the screen that is alerting you to the correct card, or perhaps you&#39;re performing some sort of gesture on the screen that triggers the star. In this situation, up the ante: tell them you can do the trick without even seeing the screen. In fact, you can do it without even <em>touching</em> the screen - they can do all the touching for you.</p><p>This works in just the same way, except now your friend is the one stroking their finger across the screen. Just wait for your Watch to tap your wrist, then say something like &quot;go back to that card - I felt something there...&quot;</p><p>Remember, misdirection is key. So, don&#39;t tap the right answer as soon as your phone vibrates. Say something like &quot;hmm... this card feels really warm... let me try some others first.&quot; Or go to one of the cards nearby and say &quot;this card feels warm, but not as warm as the previous one...&quot;</p><p>Finally, once you&#39;ve fooled everyone and had your fun, let them in on the joke - after all, if you can&#39;t have fun, why bother?</p>',9);function A(s,C){const a=r("VPCard"),h=r("router-link"),c=r("FontIcon");return y(),p("div",null,[t("h1",f,[t("a",w,[t("span",null,u(s.$frontmatter.title)+" ê´€ë ¨",1)])]),o(a,i(n({title:"Hacking with iOS â€“ learn to code iPhone and iPad apps with free Swift tutorials",desc:"Learn Swift coding for iOS with these free tutorials â€“ learn Swift, iOS, and Xcode",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/read/README.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),t("nav",k,[t("ul",null,[t("li",null,[o(h,{to:"#polishing-your-patter"},{default:d(()=>[e("Polishing your patter")]),_:1})])])]),b,o(a,i(n({title:"Wrap up | Hacking with iOS",desc:"Wrap up",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/read/37/10/wrap-up",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),_,v,t("p",null,[e("So, the app is complete and you've learned all about "),W,e(", "),S,e(", card flip effects, "),x,e(", 3D Touch and more - good job!
