It&#39;s not the most <em>complicated</em>, but it&#39;s long, coming in just short of 500 lines in total. That said, I hope it&#39;ll be worth it, because the end result is great: we&#39;re going to make a Fruit Ninja-style game, where slicing penguins is good and slicing bombs is bad. I think I must unconsciously have something against penguinsâ€¦</p><p>Anyway, in this project you&#39;re going to meet <code>SKShapeNode</code> and <code>AVAudioPlayer</code>, you&#39;re going to create <code>SKAction</code> groups, you&#39;re going to create shapes with <code>UIBezierPath</code>, and more. So, it&#39;s the usual recipe: make something cool, and learn at the same time.</p><p>This project is hard because you need to write a lot of code before you can start to see results, which I personally find frustrating. I much prefer it when I can write a few lines, see the result, write a few lines more, see the result again, and so on. That isn&#39;t possible here, so I suggest you make some coffee before you begin.</p><p>Still here? OK!</p><p>Create a new SpriteKit project in Xcode, name it Project23, then do the usual cleaning job to create a completely empty SpriteKit project: remove all the code from <code>didMove(to:)</code> and <code>touchesBegan()</code>, change the anchor point and size of GameScene.sks, and so on.</p>",5),S={href:"https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},b=t("code",null,"twostraws/HackingWithSwift",-1),v=t("p",null,"Please force the app to run only on landscape iPads before continuing.",-1),j=t("div",{class:"hint-container note"},[t("p",{class:"hint-container-title"},"Reminder"),t("p",null,"Donâ€™t forget to use a real device for this project, or, if you must, the lowest-spec iPad in the simulator.")],-1);function P(s,I){const n=i("VPCard"),c=i("VidStack"),l=i("FontIcon");return u(),h("div",null,[t("h1",f,[t("a",w,[t("span",null,g(s.$frontmatter.title)+" ê´€ë ¨",1)])]),e(n,a(r({title:"Hacking with iOS â€“ learn to code iPhone and iPad apps with free Swift tutorials",desc:"Learn Swift coding for iOS with these free tutorials â€“ learn Swift, iOS, and Xcode",link:"/hackingwithswift.com/read/README.md",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),y,_,e(n,a(r({title:"Setting up | Hacking with iOS",desc:"Setting up",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/read/23/1/setting-up",logo:"https://hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(174,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),e(c,{src:"youtube/JNg1kLsttLY"}),k,t("p",null,[o("You should also download the files for this project from "),t("a",S,[o("GitHub ("),e(l,{icon:"iconfont icon-github"}),b,o(")")]),o(", then copy its Content folder into your Xcode project.")]),v,j])}const x=p(m,[["render",P],["__file","01-setting-up.html.vue"]]),K=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/read/23/01-setting-up.html","title":"Setting up","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Setting up","description":"Article(s) > Setting up","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","xcode","appstore","ios"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > Setting up"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Setting up"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/read/23/01-setting-up.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/read/23/01-setting-up.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ðŸ“šBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Setting up"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > Setting up"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Setting up\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.42,"words":426},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/read/23/01-setting-up.md","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{x as comp,K as data};
