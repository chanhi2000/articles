However, by default scrubbing behaves differently from your regular animation: scrubbing always happens linearly, even if your animation was performed using a curve such as ease-in-ease-out.\n\nThis is actually a feature rather than a bug, and it‚Äôs incredibly intelligent ‚Äì iOS automatically maps your curve onto a linear animation at the same point, and does the same in reverse, because it can be confusing for users if they try to scrub an animation and it doesn‚Äôt follow their finger.\n\nOn the flip side, of you‚Äôre scrubbing an animation programmatically this behavior isn‚Äôt always desirable. Fortunately, iOS 11 introduced a `scrubsLinearly` property for `UIViewPropertyAnimator`: set this to false to make scrubbing retain your custom animation curve.\n\nThe default setting is true, which makes `UIViewPropertyAnimator` continue working like it did on iOS 10. To change it, just add this code:\n\n```swift\nanimator.scrubsLinearly = false\n```\n\n"),b])}const x=s(p,[["render",f],["__file","how-to-make-uiviewpropertyanimator-scrub-with-a-custom-curve-scrubslinearly.html.vue"]]),A=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-make-uiviewpropertyanimator-scrub-with-a-custom-curve-scrubslinearly.html","title":"How to make UIViewPropertyAnimator scrub with a custom curve: scrubsLinearly","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"How to make UIViewPropertyAnimator scrub with a custom curve: scrubsLinearly","description":"Article(s) > How to make UIViewPropertyAnimator scrub with a custom curve: scrubsLinearly","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-11.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > How to make UIViewPropertyAnimator scrub with a custom curve: scrubsLinearly"},{"property":"og:description","content":"How to make UIViewPropertyAnimator scrub with a custom curve: scrubsLinearly"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-make-uiviewpropertyanimator-scrub-with-a-custom-curve-scrubslinearly.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-make-uiviewpropertyanimator-scrub-with-a-custom-curve-scrubslinearly.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"How to make UIViewPropertyAnimator scrub with a custom curve: scrubsLinearly"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > How to make UIViewPropertyAnimator scrub with a custom curve: scrubsLinearly"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-11.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"How to make UIViewPropertyAnimator scrub with a custom curve: scrubsLinearly\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.47,"words":441},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-make-uiviewpropertyanimator-scrub-with-a-custom-curve-scrubslinearly.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{x as comp,A as data};
