On the other hand, many web APIs prefer snake case, written as `number_of_users` and `power_level`, so if you need to convert camel case to snake case you need to use the `keyEncodingStrategy` of `JSONEncoder`, like this:\n\n```swift\nlet encoder = JSONEncoder()\nencoder.keyEncodingStrategy = .convertToSnakeCase\n\nif let encoded = try? encoder.encode(yourData) {\n    // continue with encoded data\n}\n```\n\nWith that set, Swift can convert property names as part of the encoding process, which makes `Codable` much easier to use. \n\n"),k])}const _=s(p,[["render",u],["__file","how-to-convert-between-camel-case-and-snake-case-with-codable-and-keyencodingstrategy.html.vue"]]),C=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-convert-between-camel-case-and-snake-case-with-codable-and-keyencodingstrategy.html","title":"How to convert between camel case and snake case with Codable and keyEncodingStrategy","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"How to convert between camel case and snake case with Codable and keyEncodingStrategy","description":"Article(s) > How to convert between camel case and snake case with Codable and keyEncodingStrategy","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-8.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > How to convert between camel case and snake case with Codable and keyEncodingStrategy"},{"property":"og:description","content":"How to convert between camel case and snake case with Codable and keyEncodingStrategy"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-convert-between-camel-case-and-snake-case-with-codable-and-keyencodingstrategy.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-convert-between-camel-case-and-snake-case-with-codable-and-keyencodingstrategy.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"How to convert between camel case and snake case with Codable and keyEncodingStrategy"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > How to convert between camel case and snake case with Codable and keyEncodingStrategy"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-8.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-10-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"How to convert between camel case and snake case with Codable and keyEncodingStrategy\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-10-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.38,"words":415},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-convert-between-camel-case-and-snake-case-with-codable-and-keyencodingstrategy.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 10Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{_ as comp,C as data};
