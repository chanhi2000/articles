Both return a `CGRect` ‚Äì a rectangle containing their X and Y position, plus their width and height ‚Äì but that doesn‚Äôt mean they are the *same*.\n\nAt its simplest, a view‚Äôs bounds refers to its coordinates relative to its own space (as if the rest of your view hierarchy didn‚Äôt exist), whereas its frame refers to its coordinates relative to its parent‚Äôs space.\n\nThis means a few things:\n\n1. If you create a view at X:0, Y:0, width:100, height:100, its `frame` and `bounds` are the same.\n2. If you move that view to X:100, its frame will reflect that change but its bounds will not. Remember, the bounds is relative to the view‚Äôs own space, and internally to the view nothing has changed.\n3. If you transform the view, e.g. rotating it or scaling it up, the frame will change to reflect that, but the bounds still won‚Äôt ‚Äì as far as the view is concerned internally, it hasn‚Äôt changed.\n\nWhen you change the width or height of either `frame` or `bounds`, the other value is updated to match. Generally it‚Äôs better to modify `bounds` plus `center` and `transform`, and let UIKit calculate the `frame` for you.\n\n"),b])}const x=s(f,[["render",y],["__file","whats-the-difference-between-frame-and-bounds.html.vue"]]),S=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/whats-the-difference-between-frame-and-bounds.html","title":"What‚Äôs the difference between frame and bounds?","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"What‚Äôs the difference between frame and bounds?","description":"Article(s) > What‚Äôs the difference between frame and bounds?","category":["Swift","iOS","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","hackingwithswift.com","crashcourse","swift","swift-5.10","ios","ios-2.0","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > What‚Äôs the difference between frame and bounds?"},{"property":"og:description","content":"What‚Äôs the difference between frame and bounds?"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/whats-the-difference-between-frame-and-bounds.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/whats-the-difference-between-frame-and-bounds.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"üìöBookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"What‚Äôs the difference between frame and bounds?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > What‚Äôs the difference between frame and bounds?"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hackingwithswift.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift-5.10"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios-2.0"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"What‚Äôs the difference between frame and bounds?\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"]],"date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.61,"words":483},"filePathRelative":"hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/whats-the-difference-between-frame-and-bounds.md","localizedDate":"2019ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 28Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n"}');export{x as comp,S as data};
