Swift 2.0 introduced a lot of major language changes. You can read my full article explaining the changes with code examples <a href="/swift2">by clicking here</a>, but here are the highlights:

- Checked exceptions using \`try/catch\`
<li>Automatically synthesized headers
<li>The \`guard\` keyword to check input while unwrapping optionals
<li>Measuring strings is now done using \`characters.count\` (Note: this was later un-done in Swift 4.)
<li>Delayed code execution using the \`defer\` keyword
<li>You now get mutability warnings if you declare variables that never get changed
<li>API availability checking is now built right in
<li>The \`performSelector()\` family of functions is now available
