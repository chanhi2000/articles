It prevents the repetition of a client request within a defined time frame.</p><p>Why do we have to implement rate limiting in the API development? We&#39;ll discuss that in the next section.</p><hr><h2 id="importance-of-rate-limiting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#importance-of-rate-limiting"><span>Importance of Rate Limiting</span></a></h2><p>Here are some of the reasons why rate limiting is used in back-end application development.</p><h3 id="ddos-attacks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ddos-attacks"><span>DDoS Attacks</span></a></h3><p>First of all, it serves as a preventive measure to mitigate against DDoS attacks. DDoS attacks are malicious attacks on servers which involves flooding the server endpoints with multiple requests, often millions, resulting in reduced server efficiency and disruption of server functions. In most cases, they occur with the use of automated bots.</p><p>These attacks can be volumetric, protocol-based or application layer-based. A key example of this form of attack occurred on the GitHub website in the year 2018.</p><h3 id="web-scraping" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#web-scraping"><span>Web Scraping</span></a></h3><p>Rate limiting also plays a role in protecting web applications and web servers from unauthorized web scrapers and web crawlers. These tools, also automated, usually emit requests continually to collect relevant website data which can be exposed to unauthorized. Having a good rate limiter in place helps to prevent all these.</p><h3 id="brute-force-attack" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#brute-force-attack"><span>Brute Force Attack</span></a></h3><p>This involves trying to gain access to a server&#39;s resources by trying all possible configurations to get access to the resource. This could be done manually but is mostly automated with the use of bots as it is resource-consuming. Rate limiting also proves effective in preventing these form of attacks by disabling the requests if they exceed the required number of requests within a specific time frame.</p><h3 id="resource-optimization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#resource-optimization"><span>Resource Optimization</span></a></h3><p>Server requests usually cost the API owners some expenses in terms of running and maintenance cost. Having a rate limiter in place helps to regulate the number of requests the server can handle, help conserve cost and maximize efficiency. Subsequently, we will highlight some algorithms which rate limiters are built on.</p><hr><h2 id="adoption-and-usage-of-rate-limiting-by-popular-sites" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#adoption-and-usage-of-rate-limiting-by-popular-sites"><span>Adoption and Usage of Rate-Limiting by Popular Sites</span></a></h2><p>Rate limiting as a security measure has been adopted by a lot of tech products, ranging from large-scale to small-scale applications.

This model isn’t cost-effective.</p><h3 id="sliding-window-algorithm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sliding-window-algorithm"><span>Sliding Window Algorithm</span></a></h3><p>This algorithm is similar in configuration to the fixed window algorithm but it provides a solution to the fixed window algorithm by individualizing client access to a given number of requests within a specific time interval by creating independent time intervals for each client.</p><p>For example, if Client A accesses the request by 10:00, the client is allowed to make 10 requests until the expiration of the time by 10:03, while Client B who accesses the request by 10:02 is allowed to make 10 requests until the expiration by 10:05.</p><h3 id="leaking-bucket-algorithm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#leaking-bucket-algorithm"><span>Leaking Bucket Algorithm</span></a></h3><p>This algorithm is based on the literal meaning of its name: the leaking bucket. It ensures that only a specific number of requests can be processed by the server at any given time. Any requests exceeding this number will be discarded and issued an &quot;<strong>error 429</strong>&quot;. This is to ensure that the server is not overloaded and to guarantee maintenance of server efficiency and speed.</p><h3 id="token-bucket-algorithm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#token-bucket-algorithm"><span>Token Bucket Algorithm</span></a></h3><p>This model is similar to the leaking bucket as there is a hypothetical bucket which serves as the rate limiter. This bucket serves to manage tokens and new tokens are added periodically into the bucket.</p><p>When a request is made, a token gets discarded, and this continues until all the tokens in the bucket get depleted. At that point, any request made will be discarded with an &quot;<strong>error 429</strong>&quot;. This also helps to prevent server congestion and ensure maximal efficiency.</p><hr><h2 id="rate-limiting-best-practices" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rate-limiting-best-practices"><span>Rate Limiting Best Practices</span></a></h2><p>Efficient web API development is mainly achievable by following the best API development practices. To maximize the use of a rate limiter as an API security measure, the following needs to be implemented.</p><ul><li><strong>Firstly, choose a compatible rate-limiting algorithm.</strong> Having a strong rate-limiting algorithm in place will be essential to achieve the desired result. Choosing the best rate-limiting algorithm in sync with your API endpoint will also be needed.</li><li><strong>Ensure that the limit sets are within the reasonable limit ranges</strong>. Having arbitrary rate limit parameters set could negatively affect user experience and that could defeat its purpose. Setting a reasonable time limit to maximize user experience and militate against attacks has proven to be much more effective.</li><li><strong>Ensure efficient error handling and provide necessary feedback to the client.</strong> The default rate limiting error code is error code 429. Appropriate handling of the errors that occur during the API usage especially due to the abuse of the API will be necessary to provide the necessary feedback to the user.</li><li><strong>Implement flexible rate-limiting mechanisms across several parameters.</strong> Setting a fixed time interval across all endpoints seems to be a bad practice as some API endpoints are much more data-sensitive than others. Hence, having a flexible rate limiter that sets parameters in order of relevance helps to maximize server efficiency and ensure security.</li><li><strong>Ensure the provision of appropriate application logging, monitoring and observability tools.</strong> Having in place API metrics, logging, monitoring and observability tools also helps to serve as an additional security hack for Web APIs as they help monitor server activity, and through the use of monitoring alerts, notify the server developer when suspicious requests are detected on the server.</li><li><strong>Ensure synchronicity of rate limiting and other API security measures.</strong> Proper synchronicity of rate limiters with other API security hacks should be harnessed to potentiate the API security measures. Adequate knowledge of the security measures and expertise is needed in order not to counteract the existing security measures.</li><li><strong>Ensure proper API documentation.</strong> Adequate API documentation is also needed to ensure users, other developers and clients alike are aware of the rate-limiting practice in place to ensure compliance with the rate-limiting rules.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></a></h2><p>In conclusion, we have highlighted rate limiting as an important API security hack and some of it&#39;s real life use cases.</p>',29),D={href:"https://linktr.ee/tobilyn77",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function E(l,B){const c=o("VPCard"),h=o("SiteInfo"),a=o("router-link"),s=o("FontIcon");return f(),m("div",null,[e("h1",v,[e("a",k,[e("span",null,g(l.$frontmatter.title)+" 관련",1)])]),i(c,p(u({title:"Security > Article(s)",desc:"Article(s)",link:"/devops/security/articles/README.md",logo:"/images/ico-wind.svg",background:"rgba(10,10,10,0.2)"})),null,16),w,i(h,{name:"What is Rate Limiting?
