Nested types ‚Äì i.e. nested structs and nested classes ‚Äì are a useful way of organizing your code, and perhaps even restricting what others can do with it. In essence, a nested type is just one data type defined inside another, like this:

\`\`\`swift
struct Deck {
    struct Card {

    }
}
\`\`\`

Now rather than creating a new \`Card\` struct you would instead create a new \`Deck.Card\` because one is inside the other.

This approach is useful for organizing larger applications, because you might need custom types that are applicable only in certain places ‚Äì exposing them elsewhere might cause problems.

If you want to re-enforce this, Swift lets you mark the inner type (\`Card\` above) as being private, which means it can only be used inside the \`Deck\` class ‚Äì code from outside \`Deck\` can‚Äôt even see it.
