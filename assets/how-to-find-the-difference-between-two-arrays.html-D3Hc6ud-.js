If you have two arrays that contain similar items and want to find out their differences ‚Äì i.e., which items exist in one or the other, but not both ‚Äì the easiest thing to do is use a \`Set\`. Sets have a \`symmetricDifference()\` method that does exactly this, so you just need to convert both arrays to a set, then convert the result back into an array.

Here‚Äôs an extension to make it easier:

\`\`\`swift
extension Array where Element: Hashable {
    func difference(from other: [Element]) -> [Element] {
        let thisSet = Set(self)
        let otherSet = Set(other)
        return Array(thisSet.symmetricDifference(otherSet))
    }
}
\`\`\`

And here‚Äôs some example code you can use to try it out:

\`\`\`swift
let names1 = ["John", "Paul", "Ringo"]
let names2 = ["Ringo", "Paul", "George"]
let difference = names1.difference(from: names2)
\`\`\`

That will set \`difference\` to be \`["George", "John"]\`, because those are the two names that only appear once in either array.
