However, I encourage you to structure your methods in an organized way, and because <code>loadView()</code> gets called before <code>viewDidLoad()</code> it makes sense to position the code above it too.</p></div><p>Anyway, there are only three things we care about, because by now you should understand why we need to use the <code>override</code> keyword. (Hint: it&#39;s because there&#39;s a default implementation, which is to load the layout from the storyboard.)</p><p>First, we create a new instance of Apple&#39;s <code>WKWebView</code> web browser component and assign it to the <code>webView</code> property. Third, we make our view (the root view of the view controller) that web view.</p><p>Yes, I missed out the second line, and that&#39;s because it introduces new concept: delegation. Delegation is what&#39;s called a <em>programming pattern</em> – a way of writing code – and it&#39;s used extensively in iOS. And for good reason: it&#39;s easy to understand, easy to use, and extremely flexible.</p><p>A <em>delegate</em> is one thing acting in place of another, effectively answering questions and responding to events on its behalf. In our example, we&#39;re using WKWebView: Apple&#39;s powerful, flexible and efficient web renderer. But as smart as <code>WKWebView</code> is, it doesn&#39;t know (or care) how our application wants to behave, because that&#39;s our custom code.</p><p>The delegation solution is brilliant: we can tell <code>WKWebView</code> that we want to be informed when something interesting happens. In our code, we&#39;re setting the web view&#39;s <code>navigationDelegate</code> property to <code>self</code>, which means &quot;when any web page navigation happens, please tell me – the current view controller.”</p><p>When you do this, two things happen:</p><ol><li>You must conform to the protocol. This is a fancy way of saying, &quot;if you&#39;re telling me you can handle being my delegate, here are the methods you need to implement.&quot; In the case of <code>navigationDelegate</code>, all these methods are optional, meaning that we don&#39;t <em>need</em> to implement any methods.</li><li>Any methods you do implement will now be given control over the <code>WKWebView</code>&#39;s behavior. Any you don&#39;t implement will use the default behavior of <code>WKWebView</code>.</li></ol><p>Before we go any further, it’s time to fix the compilation error. When you set any delegate, you need to conform to the protocol that matches the delegate. Yes, all the <code>navigationDelegate</code> protocol methods are optional, but Swift doesn&#39;t know that yet. All it knows is that we&#39;re promising we&#39;re a suitable delegate for the web view, and yet haven&#39;t implemented the protocol.</p><p>The fix for this is simple, but I&#39;m going to hijack it to introduce something else at the same time, because this is an opportune moment. First, the fix: find this line:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">ViewController</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token class-name">UIViewController</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>…and change it to this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">ViewController</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token class-name">UIViewController</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token class-name">WKNavigationDelegate</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>That&#39;s the fix. But what I want to discuss is the way <code>ViewController</code> now appears to inherit from two things, which isn’t possible in Swift. As you know, when we say <code>class A: B</code> we’re defining a new class called <code>A</code> that builds on the functionality provided by class <code>B</code>. However, when we say <code>class A: B, C</code> we’re saying it inherits from <code>UIViewController</code> (the first item in the list), <em>and</em> promises it implements the <code>WKNavigationDelegate</code> protocol.</p><p>The order here really is important: the parent class (superclass) comes first, then all protocols implemented come next, all separated by commas. We&#39;re saying that we conform to only one protocol here ( <code>WKNavigationDelegate</code>) but you can specify as many as you need to.</p><p>So, the complete meaning of this line is &quot;create a new subclass of <code>UIViewController</code> called <code>ViewController</code>, and tell the compiler that we promise we’re safe to use as a <code>WKNavigationDelegate</code>.&quot;</p><p>This program is almost doing something useful, so before you run it let&#39;s add three more lines. Please place these in the <code>viewDidLoad()</code> method, just after the <code>super</code> call:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">let</span> url <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">URL</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>string<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;https://hackingwithswift.com&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token operator">!</span></span>
