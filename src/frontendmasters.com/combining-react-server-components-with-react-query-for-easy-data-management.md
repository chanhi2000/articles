  desc="Server-side component rendering can improve data loading efficiency over client-rendered SPAs. Despite their benefits, such as out-of-order streaming, they have limitations, including slow server action updates and lack of support for client-side interactivity. React Query complements RSC by managing client-side data updates, addressing some of RSC's drawbacks."
