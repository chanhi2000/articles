HTTP methods are essential in enabling communication between web applications and servers. Each method, from GET to CONNECT, is designed for a specific task, such as sending data, retrieving information, updating resources, or setting up secure connections. Choosing the correct method for the job improves the efficiency and security of your application.

GET is ideal for retrieving data, POST and PUT help with creating and updating, PATCH handles partial updates, and DELETE removes resources. HEAD checks response headers without retrieving content, OPTIONS shows supported methods, and TRACE and CONNECT assist with debugging and secure communication.

Using the appropriate HTTP methods ensures your application runs efficiently and securely, offering a smooth experience for users.
